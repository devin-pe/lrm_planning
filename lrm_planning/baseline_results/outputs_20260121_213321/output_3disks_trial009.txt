You are a logical reasoning agent. You solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle step-by-step. For every move you make, you MUST use the following format:

C. ACTION: Executing: Move disk [number] from peg [Source] to peg [Destination]
D. STATE UPDATE: [Describe current peg contents]

Continue until all disks are on the goal peg. Think carefully before each move.

Problem:
- Number of disks: 3
- Initial state: All 3 disks are on peg A (disk 1 is smallest, disk 3 is largest)
- Goal: Move all disks to peg C
- Available pegs: A, B, C

Rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty peg
3. Only the top disk of a peg can be moved

Solve this puzzle step-by-step, using the required format for each move.

Okay, I need to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle with 3 disks. Let me think about how to approach this. So, the rules are clear: only move one disk at a time, can't place a larger disk on a smaller one, and only the top disk can be moved. The goal is to get all disks from peg A to peg C.

First, I remember that the minimum number of moves required for 3 disks is 2^3 - 1 = 7 moves. So, I should plan seven moves. Each move requires me to follow the rules strictly.

The smallest disk is disk 1, the middle is disk 2, and the largest is disk 3. I'll start by moving disk 1 from A to B. That makes sense because I can only move the top disk, and disk 1 is on top of A. Moving it to B leaves A with disks 2 and 3.

Next, I need to move disk 2. Since disk 1 is now on B, which is a larger peg, I can move disk 2 from A to C. That way, I'm preparing peg C to eventually hold all disks. Now, peg C has disk 2, and peg A has only disk 3.

Then, the next logical step is to move disk 1 from B back to A. This allows me to free up peg B for future moves. Now, peg A has disks 1 and 3, disk 3 being at the bottom.

Now, I can move disk 3 from A to C. This is a crucial move because it's the largest disk, and I need it to be at the destination peg. So, peg C now has disks 2 and 3, with 3 on the bottom.

Next, I should move disk 1 from A to B again. This sets up peg B to hold the smaller disks while I move disk 2. Now, peg B has disk 1.

After that, I can move disk 2 from C to B. This allows me to place disk 2 on top of disk 1 on peg B, which is acceptable since disk 2 is larger than disk 1.

Finally, I can move disk 1 from B to C. That completes the puzzle because now all disks are on peg C in the correct order.

Let me recap each step to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Moving disk 1 to B, then disk 2 to C, disk 1 back to A, disk 3 to C, disk 1 to B again, disk 2 to B, and disk 1 to C. Each move follows the rules, and the final state has all disks on peg C. I think that's correct.

C. ACTION: Move disk 1 from A to B  
D. STATE UPDATE: A: [3, 2], B: [1], C: []
  
C. ACTION: Move disk 2 from A to C  
D. STATE UPDATE: A: [3], B: [1], C: [2]
  
C. ACTION: Move disk 1 from B to A  
D. STATE UPDATE: A: [3, 1], B: [], C: [2]
  
C. ACTION: Move disk 3 from A to C  
D. STATE UPDATE: A: [1], B: [], C: [3, 2]
  
C. ACTION: Move disk 1 from A to B  
D. STATE UPDATE: A: [], B: [1], C: [3, 2]
  
C. ACTION: Move disk 2 from C to B  
D. STATE UPDATE: A: [], B: [2, 1], C: [3]
  
C. ACTION: Move disk 1 from B to C  
D. STATE UPDATE: A: [], B: [], C: [3, 2, 1]

All disks have been successfully moved to peg C.
