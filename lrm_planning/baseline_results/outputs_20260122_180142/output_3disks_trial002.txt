You are a logical reasoning agent solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. You must follow the EXACT format below with NO deviations.

**PROBLEM:**
- Number of disks: 3
- Initial state: All 3 disks are on peg A (disk 1 is smallest, disk 3 is largest)
- Goal: Move all disks to peg C
- Available pegs: A, B, C

**RULES:**
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty peg
3. Only the top disk of a peg can be moved

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
For each move, use this format:

Move N:
Action: Move disk X from [source] to [dest]
Result: A: [disks], B: [disks], C: [disks]

Start by listing your first move, then continue until all disks are on peg C.

**EXAMPLE:**
Move 1:
Action: Move disk 1 from A to C
Result: A: [3, 2], B: [], C: [1]

Move 2:
Action: Move disk 2 from A to B
Result: A: [3], B: [2], C: [1]

... (continue until complete)

Now solve the 3-disk puzzle following this format.

Okay, so I need to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle with 3 disks. I've heard of this puzzle before, but I'm not entirely sure how to approach it. Let me think through it step by step.

First, the problem is that all three disks are on peg A, and we need to move them to peg C. The rules are that we can only move one disk at a time, and a disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty peg. Also, only the top disk of a peg can be moved.

I remember that for the Towers of Hanoi, the minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of disks. So for 3 disks, that should be 7 moves. But I don't just want to remember the formula; I want to understand the reasoning behind each move.

Let me start by visualizing the disks. Peg A has disks 1, 2, and 3, with disk 3 being the largest at the bottom and disk 1 being the smallest on top. The goal is to move all to peg C.

I think the strategy involves moving the smaller disks out of the way to allow moving the larger ones. Let me try to map this out.

1. First, I need to move disk 1. Since disk 1 is the smallest, I can move it to any peg. Let me move it from A to C. Now, peg C has disk 1 on top of nothing else, so that's okay.

Move 1: Action: Move disk 1 from A to C
Result: A: [3, 2], B: [], C: [1]

2. Next, I need to move disk 2. I can't move disk 2 directly to C because disk 1 is there, and disk 2 is larger than disk 1. So disk 2 has to go to peg B. 

Move 2: Action: Move disk 2 from A to B
Result: A: [3], B: [2], C: [1]

3. Now, I have disk 3 on A. My goal is to move disk 3 to C. But before that, I need to move everything else out of the way. So I'll move disk 1 from C to B.

Wait, can I do that? Let me check. Disk 1 is on top of C, and B has disk 2. Since disk 1 is smaller than disk 2, I can place it on top. So yes.

Move 3: Action: Move disk 1 from C to B
Result: A: [3], B: [2, 1], C: []

4. Now, I can move disk 3 from A to C. That's the first step towards the goal.

Move 4: Action: Move disk 3 from A to C
Result: A: [], B: [2, 1], C: [3]

5. Now, I need to move disk 2 and disk 1 onto peg C. But disk 2 is on peg B. To move disk 2 to C, since C has disk 3, and disk 2 is smaller than disk 3, I can do that.

Move 5: Action: Move disk 2 from B to C
Result: A: [], B: [1], C: [3, 2]

6. Now, the last disk, disk 1, is on peg B. I need to move it on top of disk 2 on peg C.

Move 6: Action: Move disk 1 from B to C
Result: A: [], B: [], C: [3, 2, 1]

Wait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me recount the moves. I thought it should take 7 moves, but I only have 6 here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Let me try again.

After move 4, peg C has disk 3. Then I need to move disk 1 back to A so that disk 2 can go to C. Wait, perhaps I should adjust my plan.

Alternative approach:

After moving disk 1 to C (move 1), disk 2 to B (move 2), then disk 1 back to A (move 3). Then disk 3 can move to C (move 4). After that, move disk 1 from A to B (move 5), then disk 2 from B to A (move 6), and finally disk 1 from B to C (move 7). Hmm, that would make it 7 moves. Maybe I need to correct my earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I confused the order. Let me outline the correct steps again.

1. Move disk 1 from A to C.

2. Move disk 2 from A to B.

3. Move disk 1 from C to B.

4. Move disk 3 from A to C.

5. Move disk 1 from B to A.

6. Move disk 2 from B to C.

7. Move disk 1 from A to C.

That makes sense. Let me adjust my earlier steps accordingly.

So, in move 3, disk 1 went from C to B, which was correct. Then move 4 moved disk 3 to C.

Then, move 5 is moving disk 1 from B to A. That's because peg C has disk 3, so disk 1 can't go there yet. So moving disk 1 back to A, which is empty, is the next step.

Then, move 6: disk 2 from B to C, placing on top of disk 3.

Move 7: disk 1 from A to C, completing the puzzle.

So the corrected sequence would be:

Move 1: Move disk 1 from A to C
Result: A: [3, 2], B: [], C: [1]

Move 2: Move disk 2 from A to B
Result: A: [3], B: [2], C: [1]

Move 3: Move disk 1 from C to B
Result: A: [3], B: [2, 1], C: []

Move 4: Move disk 3 from A to C
Result: A: [], B: [2, 1], C: [3]

Move 5: Move disk 1 from B to A
Result: A: [1], B: [2], C: [3]

Move 6: Move disk 2 from B to C
Result: A: [1], B: [], C: [3, 2]

Move 7: Move disk 1 from A to C
Result: A: [], B: [], C: [3, 2, 1]

Yes, that's correct. Each move follows the rules, and it took 7 moves, which is the minimum for 3 disks. I think this is the right approach.
