You are a helpful assistant. Solve this puzzle for me.
There are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.
The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.
3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.
The goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.

Example: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:

moves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

This means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.

Requirements:
• When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding
complete list of moves.
• The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).
• Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]

I have a puzzle with 3 disks of different sizes with
Initial configuration:
• Peg 0: 3 (bottom), 2, 1 (top)
• Peg 1: (empty)
• Peg 2: (empty)

Goal configuration:
• Peg 0: (empty)
• Peg 1: (empty)
• Peg 2: 3 (bottom), 2, 1 (top)

Rules:
• Only one disk can be moved at a time.
• Only the top disk from any stack can be moved.
• A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Find the sequence of moves to transform the initial configuration into the goal configuration.

Okay, so I need to solve this puzzle where I have three pegs and three disks. The disks are numbered 1, 2, and 3, with 1 being the smallest and 3 the largest. They're all starting on peg 0, stacked from largest at the bottom to smallest on top. My goal is to move them all to peg 2, following the rules: only move one disk at a time, can't place a larger disk on a smaller one.

I remember that the classic Tower of Hanoi problem has a known solution, but I want to figure it out step by step. Let's see. For n disks, the minimum number of moves is 2^n - 1, so for 3 disks, that's 7 moves. That's what the example had, so I should aim for 7 moves here too.

First, I think about the smallest disk, disk 1. In the initial state, it's on peg 0. Maybe the strategy is to use disk 1 as the one that shuttles between pegs to allow moving the larger disks. But I'm not sure yet, so let me start moving.

Move 1: I think I'll move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. That seems like a good starting point because it's the smallest and leaving peg 0 free might be helpful. So the state is:
Peg 0: [3, 2]
Peg 1: []
Peg 2: [1]
Moves: [[1, 0, 2]]

Now, the next move. I have disk 2 on peg 0, and I need to move it. But to move disk 2, I have to make sure the destination peg is empty or has a larger disk. So where can I move it? If I try peg 2, it has disk 1, which is smaller, so I can't put disk 2 on top. So maybe move disk 2 to peg 1. Let's do that.

Move 2: Disk 2 from 0 to 1.
Peg 0: [3]
Peg 1: [2]
Peg 2: [1]
Moves: [[1,0,2], [2,0,1]]

Next, I have disk 1 on peg 2. Perhaps I can move it again, but where? If I move it to peg 1, peg 1 has disk 2, which is larger, so that's allowed. So disk 1 from 2 to 1.

Move 3: Disk 1 from 2 to 1.
Peg 0: [3]
Peg 1: [2, 1]
Peg 2: []
Moves: [[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1]]

Now, I have all disks except disk 3 on peg 1. Maybe I should move disk 3 to peg 2. So move disk 3 from 0 to 2.

Move 4: Disk 3 from 0 to 2.
Peg 0: []
Peg 1: [2, 1]
Peg 2: [3]
Moves: [[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2]]

Next, I need to move the smaller disks (1 and 2) to peg 2. Let's see. Currently, disk 1 is on peg 1, and disk 2 is also on peg 1, with disk 1 on top. Let's try moving disk 1 again. Maybe move it to peg 0, which is now empty.

Move 5: Disk 1 from 1 to 0.
Peg 0: [1]
Peg 1: [2]
Peg 2: [3]
Moves: [[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0]]

Now, disk 2 is on peg 1, and disk 1 is on peg 0. Let's move disk 2 to peg 2, since peg 2 has disk 3, which is larger. So disk 2 from 1 to 2.

Move 6: Disk 2 from 1 to 2.
Peg 0: [1]
Peg 1: []
Peg 2: [3, 2]
Moves: [[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2]]

Finally, I have disk 1 on peg 0. I can move it to peg 2 since peg 2 has disk 2, which is larger.

Move 7: Disk 1 from 0 to 2.
Peg 0: []
Peg 1: []
Peg 2: [3, 2, 1]
Moves: [[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]]

Wait, but looking at the moves, I had the initial move being 1 to 2, then 2 to 1, but I'm not sure if I followed the correct order. Let me recount the moves:

1. Move 1: 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2: 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 3: 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move 4: 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 5: 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move 6: 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 7: 1 from 0 to 2

Yes, that looks correct. Let me check each move:

After move 1: disk 1 is on 2. Correct.

After move 2: disk 2 on 1. Correct.

After move 3: disk 1 moves from 2 to 1. Now peg 1 has 2 and 1.

After move 4: disk 3 to 2. Now peg 2 has 3.

After move 5: disk 1 moves to 0, peg 0 has 1, peg 1 has 2.

After move 6: disk 2 moves to 2. Peg 2 has 3 and 2 now.

After move 7: disk 1 from 0 to 2, final stack on peg 2.

All moves follow the rules. So this should work.

To solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for 3 disks, follow these 7 moves:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Here is the complete list of moves:

```python
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2]
]
```

Each entry in the moves list is formatted as `[disk_id, from_peg, to_peg]`, following the rules to ensure the correct order and placement.
