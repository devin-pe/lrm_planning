You are a helpful assistant. Solve this puzzle for me.

There are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg. The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.
3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.

The goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.

**Example:** With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is `[[3, 2, 1], [], []]`, and a solution might be:
`moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]`
This means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.

**Requirements:**
* When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding complete list of moves.
* The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).
* Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format:
`moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]`

I have a puzzle with 3 disks of different sizes with

**Initial configuration:**
• Peg 0: 3 (bottom), ..., 2, 1 (top)
• Peg 1: (empty)
• Peg 2: (empty)

**Goal configuration:**
• Peg 0: (empty)
• Peg 1: (empty)
• Peg 2: 3 (bottom), ..., 2, 1 (top)

**Rules:**
• Only one disk can be moved at a time.
• Only the top disk from any stack can be moved.
• A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Find the sequence of moves to transform the initial configuration into the goal configuration.

Alright, I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 3 disks. Let me think through the steps. 

First, I remember that for Tower of Hanoi, the minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of disks. So for 3 disks, that's 7 moves. I think the example given has 7 steps, which makes sense.

Let me visualize the initial state:
- Peg 0: [3, 2, 1] (from bottom to top)
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: []

I need to move all disks to Peg 2. The rules are that I can only move the top disk of any peg, and I can't place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.

I'll start by considering the smallest disk, disk 1. Since it's on top of Peg 0, it's the first one to move. Maybe I can move disk 1 to Peg 2. So move 1 is [1, 0, 2].

Now the state becomes:
- Peg 0: [3,2]
- Peg 1: []
- Peg 2: [1]

Next, I need to move disk 2. It's on top of Peg 0. I can't place it directly on Peg 2 because disk 1 is smaller and already there. So maybe move disk 2 to Peg 1. Move 2 is [2, 0, 1].

Current state:
- Peg 0: [3]
- Peg 1: [2]
- Peg 2: [1]

Now, disk 1 is on Peg 2. I want to move disk 3, but it's on Peg 0. I can't move disk 3 directly to Peg 2 because disk 1 is there, and 3 is larger. So perhaps I should move disk 1 to Peg 0 temporarily. Move 3 is [1, 2, 0].

Current state:
- Peg 0: [3,1]
- Peg 1: [2]
- Peg 2: []

Now, disk 2 is on Peg 1. I can move disk 3 to Peg 2. Move 4 is [3, 0, 2].

State after move 4:
- Peg 0: [1]
- Peg 1: [2]
- Peg 2: [3]

Next, move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 1. Move 5 is [1,0,1].

Now:
- Peg 0: []
- Peg 1: [2,1]
- Peg 2: [3]

Now, move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2. Move 6 is [2,1,2].

After move 6:
- Peg 0: []
- Peg 1: [1]
- Peg 2: [3,2]

Finally, move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2. Move 7 is [1,1,2].

Now all disks are on Peg 2. Let me check each move:

1. [1,0,2]
2. [2,0,1]
3. [1,2,0]
4. [3,0,2]
5. [1,0,1]
6. [2,1,2]
7. [1,1,2]

Wait, this results in the correct configuration, but let me verify if each step follows the rules. Moving disk 1 to peg 2, then disk 2 to peg 1. Then disk 1 to peg 0, which is valid because peg 0 has disk 3, which is larger. Moving disk 3 to peg 2, then disk 1 to peg 1. Then disk 2 to peg 2, which is okay because it's larger than disk 1 already there. Finally, disk 1 on top of peg 2. Yes, all moves are correct.

Wait a minute, but when I move disk 1 back to peg 2 in step 7, disk 1 is on top of disk 2, but disk 1 is smaller, which is allowed because a smaller disk can be on top of a larger one. So that's fine.

I think this sequence works. Let me list all the moves again to make sure I didn't miss anything.

The solution involves moving the smaller disks out of the way to allow moving the larger disks. Each step follows the rules, and the moves are correctly ordered.

`moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [3, 0, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1, 1, 0]]`
Wait, in the final move, I think I made a mistake. The last move should be moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2, not peg 0. So the correct last move is [1,1,2].

Let me correct that:

The moves should be:
1. Move 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 1 from 2 to 0
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 1 from 0 to 1
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 1 from 1 to 2

So the correct list is:

`moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [3, 0, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2]]`

Let me verify the final state after each move to be certain.

After move 1:
- peg0: [3,2], peg1: [], peg2: [1]

Move 2:
- peg0: [3], peg1: [2], peg2: [1]

Move3:
- peg0: [3,1], peg1: [2], peg2: []

Move4:
- peg0: [1], peg1: [2], peg2: [3]

Move5:
- peg0: [], peg1: [2,1], peg2: [3]

Move6:
- peg0: [], peg1: [1], peg2: [3,2]

Move7:
- peg0: [], peg1: [], peg2: [3,2,1]

Yes, that's correct.

**Final Answer:**

The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is as follows:

`moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [3, 0, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2]]`

Each move adheres to the rules, ensuring that no larger disk is placed on a smaller one and only one disk is moved at a time.
