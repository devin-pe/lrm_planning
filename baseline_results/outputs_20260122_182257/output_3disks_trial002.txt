You are a helpful assistant. Solve this puzzle for me.

There are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg. The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.
3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.

The goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.

**Example:** With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is `[[3, 2, 1], [], []]`, and a solution might be:
`moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]`
This means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.

**Requirements:**
* When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding complete list of moves.
* The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).
* Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format:
`moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]`

I have a puzzle with 3 disks of different sizes with

**Initial configuration:**
• Peg 0: 3 (bottom), ..., 2, 1 (top)
• Peg 1: (empty)
• Peg 2: (empty)

**Goal configuration:**
• Peg 0: (empty)
• Peg 1: (empty)
• Peg 2: 3 (bottom), ..., 2, 1 (top)

**Rules:**
• Only one disk can be moved at a time.
• Only the top disk from any stack can be moved.
• A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Find the sequence of moves to transform the initial configuration into the goal configuration.

Okay, so I need to solve this Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 3 disks. Let me try to figure out how to move them from peg 0 to peg 2 following the rules. I remember that the Tower of Hanoi has a classic solution, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact steps, so I'll have to work it out.

First, the initial setup is peg 0 has disks 3, 2, and 1 from bottom to top. Pegs 1 and 2 are empty. The goal is to move all disks to peg 2, maintaining the correct order so that smaller disks are always on top of larger ones.

I think the key here is to break it down step by step. For 3 disks, the minimum number of moves required is 7, so I should aim for that.

Starting with the smallest disk, disk 1. I remember that in the classic solution, the smallest disk moves in a pattern—like a cycle. So, for 3 disks, the smallest disk would move from peg 0 to peg 2, then peg 2 to peg 1, then peg 1 to peg 0, and so on. Let me try that.

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Now, peg 0 has 3 and 2 on it, peg 1 is empty, peg 2 has disk 1. That's a valid move because peg 2 was empty, so no rules are broken.

Next, I think I need to move disk 2 somewhere. Since disk 3 is the largest and can't move yet, I have to move disk 2. Where can it go? It can't go to peg 3 because we only have three pegs (0, 1, 2). Wait, peg 2 has disk 1, so if I move disk 2 to peg 2, it would be placed on top of disk 1, which is smaller. That's not allowed because you can't put a larger disk on a smaller one.

So disk 2 can't go to peg 2. Where else? The only other option is peg 1. So I move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1. Now, peg 0 has disk 3, peg 1 has disk 2, and peg 2 has disk 1. That's a valid move because peg 1 was empty, so disk 2 is just placed there.

Now, I have to move disk 1 again. Where can it go? If I move it from peg 2 to peg 0, that's possible because peg 0 has disk 3, and disk 1 is smaller than disk 3. So moving disk 1 to peg 0 would allow disk 2 to be moved up. So let's do that.

2. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0.

Now, the state is: peg 0 has 3, 1; peg 1 has 2; peg 2 is empty.

Wait, no, peg 0 already had disk 3, right? After moving disk 2 to peg 1, peg 0 had only disk 3. So moving disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0 would make peg 0 have 3 and 1 on top. But 1 is smaller than 3, so that's allowed because we can place a smaller disk on a larger one. Oh wait, no, I think I might have gotten this wrong. The rule is you can't place a larger disk on a smaller one, but placing a smaller on a larger is okay. So peg 0 can have disk 3 at the bottom and disk 1 on top now.

Wait, but I'm concerned about that because moving disk 1 there might complicate moving disk 3 later. Alternatively, maybe I should move disk 1 to peg 1, but peg 1 has disk 2, and disk 1 is smaller than 2, so that's okay.

Wait, no, let me think again. Maybe I'm complicating things. Let me list the steps as I go.

So after step 1: disk 1 is on peg 2.

Step 2: move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.

Now, I need to make space to move disk 3 later, which is the largest. So disk 1 should probably be moved to peg 1 or peg 2, but peg 2 is empty after step 1. Wait, no, peg 2 has disk 1. Oh, right. Wait, no, after step 2, peg 2 is still only disk 1 because step 2 only moved disk 2 to peg 1. So the state is:

Peg 0: 3

Peg 1: 2

Peg 2: 1

So now, I can move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1, because peg 1 has disk 2, which is larger. So that's allowed.

3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.

Wait, but why would that help? Because then peg 1 has disk 2 and 1, so disk 2 is on the bottom, disk 1 on top. Then perhaps disk 2 can't move until disk 1 is moved elsewhere. Hmm, maybe that's not the right move.

Alternatively, perhaps I should move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0, where peg 0 has disk 3, which is larger. So that would place disk 1 on top of disk 3. Wait, but that's allowed because 1 is smaller than 3. So doing that would leave peg 2 empty, which might help in moving disk 3.

So step 2: move disk 2 to peg 1.

Now, peg 0 has disk 3, peg 1 has disk 2, and peg 2 has disk 1.

Wait, no, after step 2, peg 0 has only disk 3, because we moved disk 2. Then in step 3, I should move disk 1 somewhere. The next logical step is to move it to peg 1, but it's allowed because peg 1 has disk 2. So disk 1 can go on top.

Wait, but if I do that, then peg 1 has 2 and 1, which is correct in terms of size. Then, in the next move, I can't move disk 2 because disk 1 is on top. So perhaps that's not the way to go.

Let me think again. The classic solution for 3 disks involves moving the top two disks first to an intermediate peg so that the largest disk can be moved.

So step by step for 3 disks:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Now peg 2 has disk 1.

2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.

Now peg 1 has disk 2.

3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.

Wait, that would place disk 1 on top of disk 2 on peg 1. But that's correct. Now peg 1 has disk 2 and 1.

4. Now, move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2. Because peg 2 is empty now, as disk 1 was moved to peg 1.

Wait, but after step 3, peg 2 is empty. So disk 3 can move to peg 2.

So step 4: move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.

So peg 2 now has disk 3 on the bottom.

Now, the next step is to move the two smaller disks (1 and 2) on peg 1 to peg 2. But to do that, I might need to move disk 1 first.

5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. Wait, but peg 2 has disk 3, and disk 1 is smaller, so that's allowed.peg 2 now has disk 3, 1 on top.

Wait, but then I can't place disk 2 on top because disk 1 is smaller. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the classic solution is different. Let me recount:

For 3 disks, the sequence is:

Move disk 1 from 0 to 2.

Move disk 2 from 0 to 1.

Move disk 1 from 2 to 1.

Move disk 3 from 0 to 2.

Move disk 1 from 1 to 0.

Move disk 2 from 1 to 2.

Move disk 1 from 0 to 2.

Wait, that adds up to 7 moves.

So, in the example given, the moves are:

[[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]]

Wait, but that's 7 moves, which is correct. So maybe I should stick to that.

So let's see, the first three steps as I did before:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 2.

2. Move 2 from 0 to 1.

3. Move 1 from 2 to 1.

4. Move 3 from 0 to 2.

At this point, peg 2 has 3, and peg 1 has 2 and 1.

Now, to get 2 and 1 onto peg 2, they need to be moved. But 2 is on the bottom and can't be moved until 1 is moved.

So step 5: move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.

Now, peg 0 has disk 1, peg 1 is empty again, peg 2 has 3.

Step 6: move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.

Peg 2 now has 3 and 2.

Step 7: move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, on top of 2.

This way, peg 2 has all three disks in order.

Wait, but in this case, peg 2 is the target, so maybe that's correct. But in the example given in the problem statement, the final move is 1 from 0 to 2, which would place it on top of 2 in peg 2. So that's correct.

Wait, but in my thinking above, after step 4, moving disk 3 to peg 2, the state is:

Peg 0: empty.

Peg 1: 2 and 1.

Peg 2: 3.

Then, moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0 (step 5).

Peg 0: 1.

Peg 1: 2.

Peg 2: 3.

Then step 6: move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.

Peg 2 now has 3 and 2.

Step 7: move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.

So peg 2 now has 3, 2, 1. That's the goal.

But wait, that's 7 moves, which should be the minimal number.

So putting it all together, the moves should be:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 2.

2. Move 2 from 0 to 1.

3. Move 1 from 2 to 1.

4. Move 3 from 0 to 2.

5. Move 1 from 1 to 0.

6. Move 2 from 1 to 2.

7. Move 1 from 0 to 2.

So in terms of the list provided in the example, that's the same as the given example.

But let me check again. So step by step:

After move 1: 1 is on peg 2.

Move 2: 2 is on peg 1.

Move 3: 1 is moved from peg 2 to peg 1, which is allowed because peg 1 has 2, and 1 is smaller.

So peg 1 now has 2 and 1.

Move 4: 3 is moved to peg 2. So peg 2 now has 3.

Move 5: 1 is moved from peg 1 to peg 0.

Move 6: 2 is moved from peg 1 to peg 2. But wait, peg 2 has 3, and 2 is smaller. So placing 2 on top of 3 is allowed because 3 is larger.

Then, move 7: 1 is moved from peg 0 to peg 2, which now has 3 and 2, so placing 1 on top is correct.

So the final configuration is peg 2 with 3, 2, 1 on top, which is the goal.

Wait, but in move 3, why do we move 1 to peg 1? Because that allows us to clear peg 0 for moving disk 3. Once disk 3 is moved to peg 2, we can then rearrange the smaller disks.

I think this makes sense. So the sequence of moves would be as follows, in terms of disk, from peg, to peg:

1. [1, 0, 2]
2. [2, 0, 1]
3. [1, 2, 1]
4. [3, 0, 2]
5. [1, 1, 0]
6. [2, 1, 2]
7. [1, 0, 2]

That should do it.

The sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 3 disks involves seven steps, following the classic solution. Each move adheres to the rules, ensuring that only the top disk of a peg is moved and that a larger disk is never placed on a smaller one.

**Answer:**

The required sequence of moves is:

```python
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],  # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
    [2, 0, 1],  # Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1
    [1, 2, 1],  # Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
    [3, 0, 2],  # Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2
    [1, 1, 0],  # Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
    [2, 1, 2],  # Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
    [1, 0, 2]   # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
]
