You are a logical reasoning agent. You solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle step-by-step. For every move you make, you MUST use the following format:

C. ACTION: Executing: Move disk [number] from peg [Source] to peg [Destination]
D. STATE UPDATE: [Describe current peg contents]

Continue until all disks are on the goal peg. Think carefully before each move.

Problem:
- Number of disks: 3
- Initial state: All 3 disks are on peg A (disk 1 is smallest, disk 3 is largest)
- Goal: Move all disks to peg C
- Available pegs: A, B, C

Rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty peg
3. Only the top disk of a peg can be moved

Solve this puzzle step-by-step, using the required format for each move.

Okay, I'm trying to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle with three disks. I remember that the goal is to move all disks from peg A to peg C, but I have to follow the rules: only one disk at a time, larger disks can't be placed on smaller ones, and only the top disk can be moved.

So, starting off, all three disks are on peg A. The smallest disk is disk 1, then disk 2, and the largest is disk 3. Let me visualize this: peg A has disk 3 at the bottom, disk 2 on top of it, and disk 1 on top of disk 2. Pegs B and C are empty.

I think the first move should be to move the smallest disk, disk 1, from peg A to peg C. That seems like a good starting point because peg C is empty, so I can place it there without any issues. After that move, peg A will have disks 3 and 2, peg B is still empty, and peg C has disk 1.

Next, I need to move disk 2. But before I can move disk 2 from peg A, I have to make sure that the disk it's going on top of is larger. Let's see, if I move disk 2 to peg B, that would work because peg B is empty. So I'll move disk 2 from A to B. Now peg A has only disk 3, peg B has disk 2, and peg C has disk 1.

Wait, that seems fine. Now, I can move disk 1 again. Since disk 1 is on peg C, I can move it to peg B, which has disk 2. But wait, disk 1 is smaller than disk 2, so that's allowed. So, moving disk 1 from C to B. Now peg A has disk 3, peg B has disks 2 and 1, and peg C is empty.

But wait, is that correct? Let me check. I moved disk 2 to peg B, then moved disk 1 to peg B, which is allowed because disk 1 is smaller than disk 2. So, now peg B has both disks 2 and 1, with disk 1 on top.

Now, I need to move disk 3. The only disk left on peg A is disk 3. I need to move it to peg C because that's the goal. So, I'll move disk 3 from A to C. Now, peg A is empty, peg B has disks 2 and 1, and peg C has disk 3.

Next, I should move disk 1. Disk 1 is on peg B on top of disk 2, so I can move it to peg A because peg A is empty. So, move disk 1 from B to A. Now, peg A has disk 1, peg B has disk 2, and peg C has disk 3.

Wait, but peg C has disk 3, but I need all disks on peg C. So, I should work on moving disk 2 and disk 1 onto peg C. Let me think about how to do that.

I have peg B with disk 2 and peg A with disk 1.peg C has disk 3. I need to move disk 2 onto peg C. But disk 3 is already on peg C, and disk 2 is smaller than disk 3, so I can place disk 2 on peg C. So, moving disk 2 from B to C. Now, peg B is empty, peg A has disk 1, and peg C has disks 3 and 2.

Now, I need to move disk 1 from A to B. Disk 1 can go to peg B, which is empty. So, moving disk 1 from A to B. Now, peg A is empty, peg B has disk 1, and peg C has disks 3 and 2.

Finally, I need to move disk 1 onto peg C. Disk 1 is currently on peg B, which is the smallest, and peg C has disk 2 and 3. I can place disk 1 on top of disk 2 because it's smaller. So, moving disk 1 from B to C. Now, peg C has all three disks: 3, 2, and 1, which is the goal.

Wait, but let me make sure I followed all the steps correctly. Let me recount the moves to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Move disk 1 from A to C. Now, A has 3, 2; C has 1.
2. Move disk 2 from A to B. Now, A has 3; B has 2; C has 1.
3. Move disk 1 from C to B. Now, A has 3; B has 2,1; C is empty.
4. Move disk 3 from A to C. Now, A is empty; C has 3; B has 2,1.
5. Move disk 1 from B to A. Now, A has 1; B has 2; C has 3.
6. Move disk 2 from B to C. Now, B is empty; C has 3,2; A has 1.
7. Move disk 1 from A to C. Now, C has 3,2,1; goal achieved.

Yes, that seems correct. Each move followed the rules, and I didn't place a larger disk on a smaller one. I think that's the correct sequence of moves for solving the Towers of Hanoi with three disks.
