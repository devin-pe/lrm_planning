You are a logical reasoning agent. You solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle step-by-step. For every move you make, you MUST use the following format:

C. ACTION: Executing: Move disk [number] from peg [Source] to peg [Destination]
D. STATE UPDATE: [Describe current peg contents]

Continue until all disks are on the goal peg. Think carefully before each move.

Problem:
- Number of disks: 3
- Initial state: All 3 disks are on peg A (disk 1 is smallest, disk 3 is largest)
- Goal: Move all disks to peg C
- Available pegs: A, B, C

Rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty peg
3. Only the top disk of a peg can be moved

Solve this puzzle step-by-step, using the required format for each move.

Okay, so I need to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle with 3 disks. Let me think through this step by step. I remember that the goal is to move all disks from peg A to peg C without breaking the rules. The rules are that only one disk can be moved at a time, a disk can only be placed on a larger one or an empty peg, and only the top disk can be moved.

First, I should probably start by moving the smallest disk, disk 1, because it's the easiest to move and it doesn't block the other disks. So, moving disk 1 from A to C. Wait, but peg C is empty, so that's allowed. Let me note that down.

Now, the next step. I need to move disk 2. But disk 2 is still on peg A. To move it, I need to have disk 1 not blocking. Since I moved disk 1 to C, I can now move disk 2 from A to B. That should be safe because disk 1 is on C, which is a different peg.

So, move disk 2 from A to B. Now, peg A has only disk 3 left, peg B has disk 2, and peg C has disk 1.

Next, I think I should move disk 1 again because it's the smallest and can be moved around more freely. So, moving disk 1 from C to B on top of disk 2. Now, peg B has both disk 2 and 1, peg A has disk 3, and peg C is empty.

Hmm, now I need to move disk 3. Disk 3 is on peg A, and it's the biggest, so it can only go to an empty peg or on top of a larger disk. Since all other pegs are either empty or have smaller disks, I can move disk 3 from A to C. That's allowed because peg C is empty now.

So, move disk 3 from A to C. Now, peg A is empty, peg C has disk 3, and peg B has disks 2 and 1.

Wait, now I need to move the disks from peg B to peg C on top of disk 3. But I can only move one disk at a time. So, first, I should move disk 1 from B to A, so I can free up peg B for moving disk 2.

So, move disk 1 from B to A. Now, peg A has disk 1, peg B has disk 2, and peg C has disk 3.

Next, I can move disk 2 from B to C. Disk 2 is on B, and peg C has disk 3, which is larger, so that's allowed. So, move disk 2 from B to C. Now, peg C has disks 3 and 2.

Now, I just need to move disk 1 from A to C on top of disk 2. So, move disk 1 from A to C. Now, peg C has all three disks in order, and the puzzle is solved.

Wait, let me double-check the moves to make sure I didn't break any rules.

1. Move disk 1 from A to C. Good, because it's the smallest and destination is empty.

2. Move disk 2 from A to B. Correct, as it's on top of A, and peg B is empty.

3. Move disk 1 from C to B. Yes, since it's on top of C, and peg B has disk 2, which is larger, so disk 1 can sit on top.

4. Move disk 3 from A to C. Correct because peg C is empty.

5. Move disk 1 from B to A. Yes, since peg A is empty now.

6. Move disk 2 from B to C. Correct, as peg C has disk 3, which is larger.

7. Move disk 1 from A to C. Yes, now peg C has all disks in order.

So, I think that covers all the steps without breaking any rules. Each move only moves the top disk, and each placement is on a larger disk or an empty peg.
