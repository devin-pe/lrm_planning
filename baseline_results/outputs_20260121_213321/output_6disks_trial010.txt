Okay, so I need to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle with six disks. Hmm, I remember that the classic Tower of Hanoi problem involves moving disks from one peg to another, following specific rules. The rules are that only one disk can be moved at a time, a disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty peg, and only the top disk of a peg can be moved. 

Let me start by visualizing the initial setup. There are three pegs: A, B, and C. All six disks are on peg A, with disk 1 being the smallest and disk 6 being the largest. My goal is to move all disks to peg C. I think the standard solution for this involves a recursive approach, especially for n disks. Each disk is moved in a specific order, alternating between pegs with each move. 

I recall that the minimum number of moves required for six disks is 2^6 - 1, which is 63 moves. That's a lot, but I can break it down into smaller steps. Let me think about the process step by step.

First, the strategy is to move the top n-1 disks from peg A to peg B using peg C as an auxiliary. Then, move the nth disk from peg A to peg C. Finally, move the n-1 disks from peg B to peg C using peg A as an auxiliary. So, for six disks, I can generalize this approach. 

Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the smallest disk. Disk 1 should make a specific pattern of moves, alternating between pegs in a cyclical manner. For an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves in a specific order, I think. Let me check that. Oh, right, for an even number of disks, the smallest disk moves from A to B, then B to C, and so on. So, for six disks, the smallest disk would move from A to B to C, repeatedly.

Let me outline the steps for moving smaller numbers of disks to see if I can spot a pattern. For example, moving 1 disk is straightforward—the smallest move. For two disks, move disk 1 from A to B, then disk 2 from A to C, and finally disk 1 from B to C. For three disks, it's more involved, but the principle is the same. 

So, applying this to six disks, I think each move can be determined by following the recursive approach. Let me try to list out the moves step by step. I'll start with the smallest disk, disk 1.

1. Move disk 1 from A to B.
2. Move disk 2 from A to C.
3. Move disk 1 from B to C, to stack on top of disk 2.
4. Move disk 3 from A to B.
5. Move disk 1 from C to A.
6. Move disk 2 from C to B.
7. Move disk 1 from A to B, to stack on top of disk 2 and 3.
8. Move disk 4 from A to C.
9. Move disk 1 from B to C.
10. Move disk 2 from B to A.
11. Move disk 1 from C to A, to stack on disk 2.
12. Move disk 3 from B to C.
13. Move disk 1 from A to B.
14. Move disk 2 from A to C, stacking on disk 1.
15. Move disk 1 from B to C, stacking on disk 2.
16. Move disk 5 from A to B.
17. Move disk 1 from C to A.
18. Move disk 2 from C to B.
19. Move disk 1 from A to B, stacking on disk 2.
20. Move disk 3 from C to A.
21. Move disk 1 from B to C.
22. Move disk 2 from B to C, stacking on disk 3.
23. Move disk 1 from C to C? Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go back.

I think I might be mixing up the steps. Let's try to list the moves systematically, perhaps using a table or a recursive function. The formula for the number of moves is correct, but ensuring each move is accurate is crucial. 

To avoid mistakes, I'll try to use the standard algorithm for solving Tower of Hanoi. For moving n disks from peg A to peg C, the steps are:

1. Move the top n-1 disks from A to B, using C as the auxiliary.
2. Move the nth disk from A to C.
3. Move the n-1 disks from B to C, using A as the auxiliary.

So, for n=6, it would be:

1. Move 5 disks from A to B, using C as auxiliary.
2. Move disk 6 from A to C.
3. Move 5 disks from B to C, using A as auxiliary.

This recursive breakdown can help. Let me see, moving 5 disks would involve similar steps, each time breaking it down until we reach the base case of moving 1 disk, which is straightforward.

Alternatively, for each move number, the disk being moved can be determined based on the binary representation of the move number. But that might complicate things. I think sticking with the recursive approach is better.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through each move carefully, making sure that each move is correct. Let me start writing down the moves step by step, ensuring that each move is legal.

1. Move disk 1 from A to B.
   - Pegs: A: [2,3,4,5,6], B: [1], C: []

2. Move disk 2 from A to C.
   - Pegs: A: [3,4,5,6], B: [1], C: [2]

3. Move disk 1 from B to C.
   - Pegs: A: [3,4,5,6], B: [], C: [1,2]

4. Move disk 3 from A to B.
   - Pegs: A: [4,5,6], B: [3], C: [1,2]

5. Move disk 1 from C to A.
   - Pegs: A: [1,4,5,6], B: [3], C: [2]

6. Move disk 2 from C to B.
   - Pegs: A: [1,4,5,6], B: [2,3], C: []

7. Move disk 1 from A to B.
   - Pegs: A: [4,5,6], B: [1,2,3], C: []

8. Move disk 4 from A to C.
   - Pegs: A: [5,6], B: [1,2,3], C: [4]

9. Move disk 1 from B to C.
   - Pegs: A: [5,6], B: [2,3], C: [1,4]

10. Move disk 2 from B to A.
    - Pegs: A: [2,5,6], B: [3], C: [1,4]

11. Move disk 1 from C to A.
    - Pegs: A: [1,2,5,6], B: [3], C: [4]

12. Move disk 3 from B to C.
    - Pegs: A: [1,2,5,6], B: [], C: [3,4]

13. Move disk 1 from A to B.
    - Pegs: A: [2,5,6], B: [1], C: [3,4]

14. Move disk 2 from A to C.
    - Pegs: A: [5,6], B: [1], C: [2,3,4]

15. Move disk 1 from B to C.
    - Pegs: A: [5,6], B: [], C: [1,2,3,4]

16. Move disk 5 from A to B.
    - Pegs: A: [6], B: [5], C: [1,2,3,4]

17. Move disk 1 from C to A.
    - Pegs: A: [1,6], B: [5], C: [2,3,4]

18. Move disk 2 from C to B.
    - Pegs: A: [1,6], B: [2,5], C: [3,4]

19. Move disk 1 from A to B.
    - Pegs: A: [6], B: [1,2,5], C: [3,4]

20. Move disk 3 from C to A.
    - Pegs: A: [3,6], B: [1,2,5], C: [4]

21. Move disk 1 from B to C.
    - Pegs: A: [3,6], B: [2,5], C: [1,4]

22. Move disk 2 from B to C.
    - Pegs: A: [3,6], B: [5], C: [2,1,4] → Wait, that's not right. I can't place disk 2 on top of disk 1 because disk 2 is larger than disk 1. That would break the rule. I must have made a mistake in step 22.

Hold on, moving disk 2 on top of disk 1 is not allowed because disk 2 is larger. I need to correct this. Let me go back to step 21.

After step 21, peg C has disk 1 on top. So moving disk 2 from B to C would be onto disk 1, which is smaller. That's not allowed. So I must have made an error in step 22. Let me think of the correct move here.

Wait, perhaps the sequence of moves after step 16 is different. Let's try to adjust.

After step 16, peg B has disk 5, and peg A has disks 6. I need to move the smaller disks correctly. Let me see:

17. Move disk 1 from C to A.
    - A: [1,6], B: [5], C: [2,3,4]

18. Move disk 2 from C to B.
    - B: [2,5], C: [3,4]

19. Move disk 1 from A to B.
    - B: [1,2,5], C: [3,4]

20. Move disk 3 from C to A.
    - A: [3,6], C: [4]

21. Move disk 1 from B to C.
    - C: [1,4]

22. Now, moving disk 2 from B to A.
    - A: [2,3,6], B: []

Wait, but disk 2 is smaller than disk 3, so it can go on top of disk 3. So, step 22 would be:

22. Move disk 2 from B to A.
    - A: [2,3,6], B: [], C: [1,4]

But before moving disk 2, I think I need to move disk 1 from C to some peg to free up disk 2. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me re-examine the state after step 20.

After step 20, peg A has [3,6], peg B has [1,2,5], and peg C has [4]. So, the next move is to move disk 1 from B to C, which is step 21. Then, peg B has [2,5], and peg C has [1,4].

At step 22, I need to move disk 2 from B to A, as moving it to C is not allowed because peg C has disk 1 and 4, both smaller. So moving disk 2 to A, which has disk 3 and 6. Since disk 2 is smaller than disk 3, it can be placed on top of disk 3. That should be correct.

So, step 22: Move disk 2 from B to A, stacking on disk 3.

Now, peg A has [2,3,6], peg B has [5], and peg C has [1,4].

23. Move disk 1 from C to B.
    - B: [1,5], C: [4]

24. Move disk 4 from C to A.
    - A: [4,2,3,6], C: []

Wait, can I move disk 4 on top of disk 2? No, because disk 4 is larger than disk 2. That's not allowed. I made another mistake here. I need to ensure that when moving a disk, it's only placed on a larger disk or an empty peg.

So, from peg C, disk 4 is on top. I need to move it, but peg A has disk 2 on top, which is smaller than disk 4. Therefore, I can't move disk 4 to peg A. Peg B has disk 5, which is larger than disk 4, so I can move disk 4 to peg B.

So, step 24: Move disk 4 from C to B.

Then peg B has [4,5], peg A has [2,3,6], and peg C is empty.

25. Move disk 1 from B to A.
    - A: [1,2,3,6], B: [4,5], C: []

26. Move disk 2 from A to C.
    - A: [3,6], B: [4,5], C: [2]

27. Move disk 1 from A to C.
    - C: [1,2], A: [6], B: [4,5]

28. Move disk 3 from A to B.
    - B: [3,4,5], A: [6], C: [1,2]

29. Move disk 1 from C to A.
    - A: [1,6], C: [2], B: [3,4,5]

30. Move disk 2 from C to B.
    - B: [2,3,4,5], C: [], A: [1,6]

31. Move disk 1 from A to B.
    - B: [1,2,3,4,5], A: [6], C: []

32. Move disk 6 from A to C.
    - C: [6], B: [1,2,3,4,5], A: []

33. Move disk 1 from B to A.
    - A: [1], B: [2,3,4,5], C: [6]

34. Move disk 2 from B to C.
    - C: [2,6], B: [3,4,5], A: [1]

35. Move disk 1 from A to C.
    - C: [1,2,6], B: [3,4,5], A: []

36. Move disk 3 from B to A.
    - A: [3], B: [4,5], C: [1,2,6]

37. Move disk 1 from C to B.
    - B: [1,4,5], C: [2,6], A: [3]

38. Move disk 2 from C to A.
    - A: [2,3], C: [6], B: [1,4,5]

39. Move disk 1 from B to C.
    - C: [1,6], B: [4,5], A: [2,3]

40. Move disk 4 from B to C.
    - Can I move disk 4 onto disk 1? No, because disk 4 is larger than disk 1. So I have to move disk 4 to an empty peg or on top of a larger disk. Peg A has disk 2 and 3, which are smaller than 4. So I can move disk 4 to peg A, but peg A has disk 3 on top. Wait, disk 4 is larger than disk 3, so I can't place it on peg A either. Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption here. Let me see.

Wait, after step 37, peg B has [1,4,5], peg C has [2,6], and peg A has [3]. So, to move disk 4, I need to find a peg where it can be placed. Peg C has disk 6, which is larger, so disk 4 can go there. So step 40: Move disk 4 from B to C, placing it on top of disk 6.

Now, peg C has [4,6], peg B has [5], peg A has [2,3].

41. Move disk 5 from B to A.
    - A: [5,2,3], B: [], C: [4,6]

But wait, can disk 5 be placed on peg A, which has disk 2 and 3 on top? Disk 5 is larger than disk 2, so it's allowed.

Wait, no. The top disk on peg A is disk 3, which is smaller than 5, so no, disk 5 cannot be placed on top of disk 3. I must have made an error here. Let's correct it.

After step 40, peg B has [5], peg C has [4,6], peg A has [2,3,1]? No, wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Let me recount after step 39:

39. Move disk 1 from B to C. So peg C has [1,6], and peg B has [4,5]. Peg A has [2,3].

40. Move disk 4 from B to C. So, since peg C has disk 1, can I move disk 4 there? No, because disk 4 is larger than 1. So I need to move disk 4 somewhere else. The options are peg A or peg B. Peg A has disk 2 and 3, with 3 on top. Disk 4 can go on peg A because 4 is larger than 3.

So step 40: Move disk 4 from B to A.

Now, peg A has [4,2,3], peg B has [5], and peg C has [1,6].

41. Move disk 2 from A to B.
    - Peg B: [2,5], A: [4,3], C: [1,6
