Okay, so I'm trying to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 7 disks. I remember that the goal is to move all the disks from peg A to peg C, following the rules that only one disk can be moved at a time, and a larger disk can't be placed on top of a smaller one. Also, only the top disk of a peg can be moved. 

Let me start by recalling how I approached smaller numbers of disks. For 1 disk, it's simple: move it from A to C. For 2 disks, I move the smaller one from A to B, then the larger one from A to C, and finally the smaller one from B to C. But with 3 disks, it gets a bit trickier. I think I have to move the top two disks to the auxiliary peg first before moving the largest one. 

Wait, so for 7 disks, maybe I should break it down into smaller sub-problems? I remember that the minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of disks. So for 7 disks, that's 2^7 - 1 = 127 moves. That seems a lot, but I guess it's manageable if I follow a systematic approach.

The strategy I know is recursive: to move n disks from A to C, first move (n-1) disks from A to B, using C as the auxiliary. Then move the nth disk from A to C. Finally, move the (n-1) disks from B to C, using A as the auxiliary. 

So, applying that to 7 disks, the first step is to move the top 6 disks from A to B. But to move those 6 disks, I'd need to apply the same strategy. That seems complicated, but maybe I can just follow the steps methodically.

Let me list out the initial state: all 7 disks, with disk 1 on top, down to disk 7 at the bottom, all on peg A. Pegs B and C are empty.

I think I'll start by moving disk 1 from A to B. That should be the first move. Then, disk 2 from A to C. Disk 1 is the smallest, so I can place it on top of disk 2. Wait, disk 1 is smaller than disk 2, so that's okay. Hmm, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Maybe it's better to just follow the standard recursive approach step by step.

Alternatively, I remember that for an even number of disks, the first move is to move disk 1 to peg B, and for an odd number, it's to peg C. But wait, in this case, there are 7 disks, which is odd, so maybe I should move disk 1 to peg C. But I think the standard method for 7 disks starts with moving disk 1 to peg B. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing something. Let me check.

Wait, I think the standard solution for Tower of Hanoi alternates the direction based on the number of disks. For even n, the first move is to peg B, and for odd n, to peg C. But since n=7 is odd, perhaps I should start by moving disk 1 to peg C.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's safer to just proceed step by step, following the recursive plan. Let me try that.

To move 7 disks from A to C, I need to:

1. Move 6 disks from A to B, using C as auxiliary.
2. Move disk 7 from A to C.
3. Move 6 disks from B to C, using A as auxiliary.

Okay, so let's focus on the first step: moving 6 disks from A to B. This is also a recursive problem. To move 6 disks, I have to move the top 5 disks from A to C, using B as auxiliary. Then move disk 6 from A to B. Then move the 5 disks from C to B, using A as auxiliary.

But this approach is getting quite nested. Maybe I can just start executing the moves step by step without getting too deep into the recursion right now.

Wait, perhaps there's a pattern with the number of moves. The first move is disk 1 from A to B. Then disk 2 from A to C. Then disk 1 from B to C. Then disk 3 from A to B. Then disk 1 from C to A, disk 2 from C to B, disk 1 from A to B. Then disk 4 from A to C, and so on. But with 7 disks, this will be a lot more steps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern for the moves when the number of disks is 7. Maybe the moves alternate between moving the smallest disk in a certain pattern. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach it step by step. Let's outline the first few moves.

1. Move disk 1 from A to B.
2. Move disk 2 from A to C.
3. Move disk 1 from B to C.
4. Move disk 3 from A to B.
5. Move disk 1 from C to A.
6. Move disk 2 from C to B.
7. Move disk 1 from A to B.
8. Move disk 4 from A to C.
9. Move disk 1 from B to C.
10. Move disk 2 from B to A.
11. Move disk 1 from C to A.
12. Move disk 3 from B to C.
13. Move disk 1 from A to B.
14. Move disk 2 from A to C.
15. Move disk 1 from B to C.
16. Move disk 5 from A to B.
... and so on.

Wait, this might take too long, but I think each time, the smallest disk is moving in a certain pattern. For an odd number of disks, disk 1 moves in a cyclic pattern: A→B→C→A, and for even n, it goes A→C→B→A. Since 7 is odd, disk 1 cycles through A→B→C→A.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should stick to the recursive approach. Let's try to list the first few moves:

1. Move disk 1 from A to B.
2. Move disk 2 from A to C.
3. Move disk 1 from B to C.
4. Move disk 3 from A to B.
5. Move disk 1 from C to A.
6. Move disk 2 from C to B.
7. Move disk 1 from A to B.
8. Move disk 4 from A to C.
9. Move disk 1 from B to C.
10. Move disk 2 from B to A.
11. Move disk 1 from C to A.
12. Move disk 3 from B to C.
13. Move disk 1 from A to B.
14. Move disk 2 from A to C.
15. Move disk 1 from B to C.
16. Move disk 5 from A to B.
... and this continues until all disks are on C.

Wait, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to list all the moves without getting lost. Each time, after moving disk k, there's a sequence of smaller disks moving around to allow the next disk to be moved. It might be helpful to simulate the initial steps, but I'm concerned about making mistakes since it's a long process.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that each move alternates between moving the smallest disk and moving the next smallest disk in a specific way. But I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to just start executing the moves step by step, keeping track of the state after each move.

But given the time, maybe I can outline the first few moves and then use the recursive method to list all moves up to the 43rd or so, but that seems tedious. Wait, but I remember that for 7 disks, the total number of moves is 127, which is a lot. Perhaps, instead of writing out all moves here, I can explain the process, but the user wants each move listed step by step with the specified format. So, I need to proceed carefully.

Wait, maybe I can write a loop or find a pattern, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can consider the standard solution and list the moves accordingly.

Wait, another approach: each time, the smallest disk moves in a specific pattern, and the larger disks move one by one to their final destinations. So, perhaps I can track that. Let me try to list the moves step by step.

1. Move disk 1 from A to B.
2. Move disk 2 from A to C.
3. Move disk 1 from B to C.
4. Move disk 3 from A to B.
5. Move disk 1 from C to A.
6. Move disk 2 from C to B.
7. Move disk 1 from A to B.
8. Move disk 4 from A to C.
9. Move disk 1 from B to C.
10. Move disk 2 from B to A.
11. Move disk 1 from C to A.
12. Move disk 3 from B to C.
13. Move disk 1 from A to B.
14. Move disk 2 from A to C.
15. Move disk 1 from B to C.
16. Move disk 5 from A to B.
17. Move disk 1 from C to A.
18. Move disk 2 from C to B.
19. Move disk 1 from A to B.
20. Move disk 3 from C to A.
21. Move disk 1 from B to C.
22. Move disk 2 from B to A.
23. Move disk 1 from C to A.
24. Move disk 4 from C to B.
25. Move disk 1 from A to B.
26. Move disk 2 from A to C.
27. Move disk 1 from B to C.
28. Move disk 3 from A to B.
29. Move disk 1 from C to A.
30. Move disk 2 from C to B.
31. Move disk 1 from A to B.
32. Move disk 4 from B to C.
33. Move disk 1 from B to C.
34. Move disk 2 from B to A.
35. Move disk 1 from C to A.
36. Move disk 3 from B to C.
37. Move disk 1 from A to B.
38. Move disk 2 from A to C.
39. Move disk 1 from B to C.
40. Move disk 6 from A to B.
... and so on until all disks are on C.

Wait, this is taking too long, and I might make a mistake. Maybe I should find a better way to structure the moves, perhaps by following the recursive approach more carefully. Let me try again.

             - Move 2 disks from C to A, using B.
                - Move disk 1 from C to B.
                - Move disk 2 from C to A.
                - Move disk 1 from B to A.
          - Move disk 4 from B to C.
          - Move 3 disks from A to C, using B.
             - Move 2 disks from A to B, using C.
                - Move disk 1 from A to C.
                - Move disk 2 from A to B.
                - Move disk 1 from C to B.
             - Move disk 3 from A to C.
             - Move 2 disks from B to C, using A.
                - Move disk 1 from B to A.
                - Move disk 2 from B to C.
                - Move disk 1 from A to C.
   - Move disk 6 from A to B.
2. Move disk 7 from A to C.
3. Move 6 disks from B to C, using A as auxiliary.

This is extremely nested and complicated, but perhaps by expanding each step, I can list all the moves. But it's going to be time-consuming. Instead, maybe I can note that each disk moves in a specific pattern, and for disk k, the move occurs at step 2^(k) moves apart, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, I can use the standard approach of moving the smallest disk in a certain direction, then the next smallest, and so on. Let me try to write the moves step by step, as per the required format:

1. C. ACTION: Executing: Move disk 1 from peg A to peg B

3. C. ACTION: Executing: Move disk 1 from peg B to peg C
