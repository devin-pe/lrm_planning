You are a logical reasoning agent solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. You must follow the EXACT format below with NO deviations.

**PROBLEM:**
- Number of disks: 3
- Initial state: All 3 disks are on peg A (disk 1 is smallest, disk 3 is largest)
- Goal: Move all disks to peg C
- Available pegs: A, B, C

**RULES:**
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty peg
3. Only the top disk of a peg can be moved

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
For each move, use this format:

Move N:
Action: Move disk X from [source] to [dest]
Result: A: [disks], B: [disks], C: [disks]

Start by listing your first move, then continue until all disks are on peg C.

**EXAMPLE:**
Move 1:
Action: Move disk 1 from A to C
Result: A: [3, 2], B: [], C: [1]

Move 2:
Action: Move disk 2 from A to B
Result: A: [3], B: [2], C: [1]

... (continue until complete)

Now solve the 3-disk puzzle following this format.

Okay, so I need to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle with 3 disks. All disks are initially on peg A, and I need to move them all to peg C. I remember that the classic solution involves moving the smallest disk first, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think through it step by step.

First, the rules: I can only move one disk at a time, and I can't place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. The pegs are A, B, and C. Since I'm a bit confused about the exact moves, maybe I can break it down.

Let me label the disks as 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest). So initially, peg A has [3, 2, 1], and B and C are empty.

I think the key is to move the smallest disk (disk 1) first. So, maybe the first move is to move disk 1 from A to C. Let me check that. After that, peg A will have [3, 2], peg B is empty, and peg C will have [1]. That seems right because I can't place a larger disk on top of a smaller one yet.

Next, I need to move disk 2. Where should it go? It can't go to C because there's disk 1 there, and disk 2 is bigger. So, I'll move disk 2 from A to B. Now, peg A has [3], peg B has [2], and peg C has [1].

Now, I need to move disk 3. The only option is to move it to C, since it's the largest. So, I move disk 3 from A to C. Now, peg A is empty, peg B has [2], and peg C has [3, 1]. Wait, but disk 1 is on top of peg C, and disk 3 is larger. So, can I just place disk 3 on top of disk 1? No, because I can't place a larger disk on a smaller one. So, that would be a problem. Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my steps. Let me backtrack.

After moving disk 1 to C and disk 2 to B, perhaps the next move should be to move disk 1 from C back to A. Wait, but peg A is empty, so that should be allowed. Let's try that.

Wait, no, because disk 3 is on peg A, which is larger, so I can place disk 1 on top of disk 3. So, moving disk 1 from C to A would result in peg A having [3, 1], peg B has [2], and peg C is empty. Then, I can move disk 3 from A to C, which would give peg C as [3], peg A as [1], peg B as [2]. Now, I can move disk 1 from A to B, landing on disk 2, since disk 1 is smaller. So, peg B would now have [2, 1], peg A is empty, peg C has [3]. Then, I can move disk 2 from B to C, placing it on top of disk 3. Now, peg C has [3, 2], peg B is empty, peg A is empty. Finally, move disk 1 from B to C, placing it on top of disk 2.

Wait, that seems more correct. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should lay it out step by step.

Alternatively, I've heard that for an odd number of disks, the optimal strategy is to move the smallest disk to the right, but with pegs A, B, C, the right would be from A to C, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the classic solution for 3 disks involves 7 moves. Let me try to list them properly.

Move 1: Move disk 1 from A to C. Now, A has [3,2], B is empty, C has [1].

Move 2: Move disk 2 from A to B. Now, A has [3], B has [2], C has [1].

Move 3: Move disk 1 from C to B. Now, A has [3], B has [2,1], C is empty.

Move 4: Move disk 3 from A to C. Now, A is empty, B has [2,1], C has [3].

Move 5: Move disk 1 from B to A. Now, A has [1], B has [2], C has [3].

Move 6: Move disk 2 from B to C. Now, A has [1], B is empty, C has [3,2].

Move 7: Move disk 1 from A to C. Now, C has [3,2,1], and A and B are empty.

Wait, that seems to make sense. So, in this scenario, after each move, the configuration is as follows. Let me check if each move follows the rules.

Move 1: Correct, disk 1 moves to C.

Move 2: Disk 2 moves from A to B, which is allowed since B is empty.

Move 3: Disk 1 moves from C to B, on top of disk 2, which is allowed because it's smaller.

Move 4: Disk 3 moves from A to C, allowed since C is empty.

Move 5: Disk 1 moves from B to A, which is allowed as A is empty.

Move 6: Disk 2 moves from B to C, on top of disk 3, which is allowed.

Move 7: Disk 1 moves from A to C, on top of disk 2, which is allowed.

So, the final configuration has all disks on peg C in the correct order. Yep, that works. So, I think this is the correct sequence of moves.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the initial thinking, I thought I might have made a mistake when moving disk 3 to C, but after adjusting, the sequence works.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the recursive method. For n disks, you move the top n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg, move the nth disk to the target peg, then move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the target.

So, for 3 disks, first move disks 1 and 2 from A to B, using C as auxiliary. Then move disk 3 from A to C. Then move disks 1 and 2 from B to C, using A as auxiliary.

This approach aligns with the 7 moves I thought of earlier.

So, I think that's the correct path. Now, let me lay out each move as per the required format.
