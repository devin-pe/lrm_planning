You are a logical reasoning agent solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. You must follow the EXACT format below with NO deviations.

**PROBLEM:**
- Number of disks: 3
- Initial state: All 3 disks are on peg A (disk 1 is smallest, disk 3 is largest)
- Goal: Move all disks to peg C
- Available pegs: A, B, C

**RULES:**
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty peg
3. Only the top disk of a peg can be moved

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
For each move, use this format:

Move N:
Action: Move disk X from [source] to [dest]
Result: A: [disks], B: [disks], C: [disks]

Start by listing your first move, then continue until all disks are on peg C.

**EXAMPLE:**
Move 1:
Action: Move disk 1 from A to C
Result: A: [3, 2], B: [], C: [1]

Move 2:
Action: Move disk 2 from A to B
Result: A: [3], B: [2], C: [1]

... (continue until complete)

Now solve the 3-disk puzzle following this format.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle with three disks. I remember the rules: I can only move one disk at a time, I can't place a larger disk on top of a smaller one, and I can only move the top disk of a peg. The goal is to move all disks from peg A to peg C. Let's see how to approach this.

First, I think about the strategy. For three disks, I remember that it takes a certain number of moves, maybe 7? I'm not entirely sure, but I can figure it out step by step. The key idea is to move the smallest disks out of the way to create space for the larger ones.

Let me start by looking at Move 1. I can only move the top disk, which is disk 1 from peg A. Where can I move it? I can choose either peg B or peg C. Maybe moving it to peg C makes sense because that's the target peg, but I'm not sure if that's the optimal first step. Alternatively, moving disk 1 to peg B could be better. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about moving disk 1 to peg C first. Then peg A will have disks 3 and 2 left. That might make it easier to move disk 2 next. Let me try that. So Move 1: Move disk 1 from A to C. Now, the state is A: [3,2], B: [], C: [1].

Move 2: Next, I need to move disk 2. It's on top of disk 3 on peg A. I can move disk 2 to either peg B or peg C. Since disk 1 is on peg C, I can't place disk 2 on top of it because disk 2 is larger than disk 1. So I have to move disk 2 to peg B. So Move 2: Move disk 2 from A to B. Now, A: [3], B: [2], C: [1].

Move 3: Now, disk 1 is on peg C. I can move it again. Maybe I should move disk 1 from C to B to make space for disk 3. Wait, but peg B has disk 2 now. Can I place disk 1 on top of disk 2? Yes, because disk 1 is smaller. So Move 3: Move disk 1 from C to B. Now, A: [3], B: [2,1], C: [].

Move 4: Now, I need to move the largest disk, which is disk 3. It's currently on peg A. I can move it to either peg B or C. Peg B has two disks, but the top disk is 1. So I can't move disk 3 on top of a smaller disk. Peg C is empty, so I can move disk 3 there. So Move 4: Move disk 3 from A to C. Now, A: [], B: [2,1], C: [3].

Move 5: Now, I need to move the remaining disks frompeg B to peg C. Disk 1 is on top of peg B, so I can move it to peg C. Peg C has disk 3, so I can place disk 1 on top. Move 5: Move disk 1 from B to C. Now, A: [], B: [2], C: [3,1].

Move 6: Now, disk 2 is on peg B. I need to move it to peg C. But peg C has disk 3 and disk 1. I can't place disk 2 on top of disk 1 because disk 2 is larger than 1. So instead, I have to move disk 1 out of the way. Move disk 1 from C to A. So Move 6: Move disk 1 from C to A. Now, A: [1], B: [2], C: [3].

Move 7: Now, I can move disk 2 from peg B to peg C. Since peg C has only disk 3, which is larger, I can place disk 2 on top. Move 7: Move disk 2 from B to C. Now, peg C has [3,2]. Then, I need to move disk 1 back from A to C. But that would require moving it again. Wait, did I already do that in Move 5? Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, after Move 6, peg A has disk 1, peg B has disk 2, and peg C has disk 3. Then, in Move 7, moving disk 2 to C would leave peg B empty, and I can then move disk 1 to C on top of disk 2. So the final moves would be:

Move 7: Move disk 2 from B to C. But peg C has disk 3, so yes. Now, A: [1], B: [], C: [3,2].

Move 8: Now, move disk 1 from A to C. Now, all disks are on peg C: C: [3,2,1]. That completes the puzzle.

Wait, but I thought it should take 7 moves. Did I make an error in my count? Let me recount.

Move 1:_disk1 to C

Move 2: disk2 to B

Move3: disk1 to B

Move4: disk3 to C

Move5: disk1 to C

Move6: disk1 to A

Move7: disk2 to C

Move8: disk1 to C

Hmm, that's 8 moves, which is more than the minimum. I think I made a mistake in the sequence. Perhaps I should find a more optimal path.

Let me start over.

Move 1: disk1 from A to C

Move 2: disk2 from A to B

Move3: disk1 from C to B

Move4: disk3 from A to C

Move5: disk1 from B to A

Move6: disk2 from B to C

Move7: disk1 from A to C

That's 7 moves, which is the minimum required for three disks. So I think I made an error in my initial sequence by moving disk1 back to C in Move5 and then again in Move6 and 7, which extended the number of moves.

So the correct sequence should be:

Move1: disk1 A→C

Move2: disk2 A→B

Move3: disk1 C→B

Move4: disk3 A→C

Move5: disk1 B→A

Move6: disk2 B→C

Move7: disk1 A→C

Now, let's verify each step:

After Move1: A: [3,2], B: [], C: [1]

Move2: A: [3], B: [2], C: [1]

Move3: A: [3], B: [2], C: [1] becomes A: [3], B: [2,1], C: []

Wait no, Move3 is moving disk1 from C to B. Wait, that would make B have disks2 and 1. So After Move3: A: [3], B: [2,1], C: []

But then Move4: disk3 from A to C. So C: [3]

Move5: disk1 from B to A. So A has [3,1], B: [2], C: [3]

Wait, no, moving disk1 from B to A would make A: [3,1], since you can't place disk1 on disk3. Wait, peg A was empty after Move4 except for disk3, but disk3 is larger than disk1, so you can place disk1 on top.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me lay it out step by step more carefully.

Move1: disk1 from A to C
A: [3,2], B: [], C: [1]

Move2: disk2 from A to B
A: [3], B: [2], C: [1]

Move3: disk1 from C to B
A: [3], B: [2,1], C: []

Move4: disk3 from A to C
A: [], B: [2,1], C: [3]

Move5: disk1 from B to A
A: [1], B: [2], C: [3]

Move6: disk2 from B to C
A: [1], B: [], C: [3,2]

Move7: disk1 from A to C
A: [], B: [], C: [3,2,1]

Yes, that works in 7 moves. So I think I initially made a mistake by moving disk1 back to C earlier, which caused more moves. The correct path is the one above.

Now, following the correct sequence with clear steps:

Move 1:
Action: Move disk 1 from A to C
Result: A: [3,2], B: [], C: [1]

Move 2:
Action: Move disk 2 from A to B
Result: A: [3], B: [2], C: [1]

Move 3:
Action: Move disk 1 from C to B
Result: A: [3], B: [2,1], C: []

Move 4:
Action: Move disk 3 from A to C
Result: A: [], B: [2,1], C: [3]

Move 5:
Action: Move disk 1 from B to A
Result: A: [1], B: [2], C: [3]

Move 6:
Action: Move disk 2 from B to C
Result: A: [1], B: [], C: [3,2]

Move 7:
Action: Move disk 1 from A to C
Result: A: [], B: [], C: [3,2,1]

The puzzle is solved in 7 moves.
