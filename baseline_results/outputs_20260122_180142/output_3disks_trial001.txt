You are a logical reasoning agent solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. You must follow the EXACT format below with NO deviations.

**PROBLEM:**
- Number of disks: 3
- Initial state: All 3 disks are on peg A (disk 1 is smallest, disk 3 is largest)
- Goal: Move all disks to peg C
- Available pegs: A, B, C

**RULES:**
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty peg
3. Only the top disk of a peg can be moved

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
For each move, use this format:

Move N:
Action: Move disk X from [source] to [dest]
Result: A: [disks], B: [disks], C: [disks]

Start by listing your first move, then continue until all disks are on peg C.

**EXAMPLE:**
Move 1:
Action: Move disk 1 from A to C
Result: A: [3, 2], B: [], C: [1]

Move 2:
Action: Move disk 2 from A to B
Result: A: [3], B: [2], C: [1]

... (continue until complete)

Now solve the 3-disk puzzle following this format.

Alright, I need to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle with 3 disks using the exact format specified. Let me start by understanding the problem. I have 3 disks on peg A, with disk 1 being the smallest and disk 3 the largest. My goal is to move all of them to peg C, following the rules: only one disk at a time, can't place a larger disk on a smaller one, and only the top disk can be moved.

First, I remember that the minimum number of moves for 3 disks is 7. So, I need to plan each move carefully. The strategy is usually recursive: move the top two disks to an intermediate peg, move the largest disk to the target peg, then move the smaller disks onto the largest one.

So, starting with all disks on A, my initial state is A: [3,2,1], B: [], C: []. 

Move 1: I should move disk 1 from A to C. That's straightforward because it's the smallest and no other disks are on top of it. After this move, A will have disks 3 and 2, B remains empty, and C has disk 1.

Move 2: Now, I need to move disk 2. But disk 2 can't go directly to C because disk 1 is there, and I can't place a larger disk on a smaller one. So, I move disk 2 from A to B. Now, A has just disk 3, B has disk 2, and C has disk 1.

Move 3: Next, I move disk 3, the largest, from A to C. This is the first time I'm moving the largest disk, so that's a key point. Now, A is empty, B has disk 2, and C has disks 3 and 1 on top of each other.

Move 4: Now, I need to move disk 1 from C to B so that I can free up disk 3 to move, but wait, no, since disk 3 is already on C, maybe I should move disk 1 to B to allow moving disk 2 onto C next. So, moving disk 1 from C to B. Now, A is empty, B has disks 2 and 1, and C has disk 3.

Move 5: Now, I can move disk 2 from B to C. Since disk 3 is on C, it's larger, so this move is allowed. Now, A is empty, B has disk 1, and C has disks 3 and 2.

Move 6: Then, I need to move disk 1 from B to A. Wait, that doesn't seem right because my goal is to have all disks on C. Alternatively, I should move disk 1 from B to C, but can't because disk 2 is smaller than disk 1? No, disk 1 is smaller than disk 2. Wait, that's not correct. Disk 1 is smaller, so I can place it on top of disk 2. Let me think again.

Wait, after Move 3, disk 1 is on C, which was on top of disk 3. Then in Move 4, I move disk 1 to B, so disk 1 is on B. Then Move 5 is to move disk 2 from B to C, which is allowed because disk 3 is on C and disk 2 is smaller. Now, in Move 6, I can move disk 1 from B to C again, placing it on top of disk 2.

So, Move 6: Move disk 1 from B to C. Now, C has disks 3, 2, 1. B is empty, and A is empty. That would complete the puzzle.

Wait, but that would mean only 6 moves, but I thought it should take 7. Let me recount.

Wait, no, let me go back.

After Move 3: C has disk 3 and 1 on top? Wait, no, because when I moved disk 1 to C in Move 1, then disk 2 from A to B in Move 2, then disk 3 from A to C in Move 3. So C has disk 3 and 1, but that's impossible because disk 3 is larger than disk 1. So, when I move disk 3 to C, which already has disk 1, I can't stack disk 3 on top of disk 1 because that's against the rules. Oh, I see! I made a mistake there.

Wait, no, because the rules say you can place a disk on an empty peg or on top of a larger disk. So disk 3 is being moved to C, which has disk 1. Since disk 1 is smaller, can I do that? No, because you can only place a smaller disk on a larger one. So disk 3 can be placed on C only if C is empty or has a disk larger than 3, which isn't the case. So moving disk 3 to C when C has disk 1 is invalid.

Oh, so I was wrong in Move 3. That move isn't allowed. I need to correct that. So I can't move disk 3 to C directly; I have to move it to B, or maybe move disk 1 out of the way first.

Let me start over with the correct approach.

Move 1: Move disk 1 from A to C. Now, A has [3,2], B is empty, C has [1].

Move 2: Move disk 2 from A to B. A has [3], B has [2], C has [1].

Move 3: Move disk 1 from C to B. Now, A has [3], B has [2,1], C is empty.

Wait, but I thought that was a wrong step. Let me see: after Move 2, I have disks on A: 3, and B: 2, C:1.

Now, I need to move disk 3 to C, but C has disk 1, and disk 3 is larger. So I can't do that. Therefore, I need to first move disk 1 from C to B. That's Move 3: Move disk 1 from C to B. Now, C is empty.

Now, I can move disk 3 from A to C, which is Move 4: Move disk 3 to C. Now, A is empty, B has [2,1], C has [3].

Next, I need to move disk 2 and 1 from B to C. So, first, move disk 2 from B to A? No, because A is empty. But wait, disk 2 is larger than disk 1. Wait, I need to move disk 1 first.

Move 5: Move disk 1 from B to A. Now, B has [2], A has [1], C has [3].

Move 6: Move disk 2 from B to C. Now, C has [3,2], B is empty, A has [1].

Move 7: Move disk 1 from A to C. Now, C has [3,2,1], and we're done.

So, the correct sequence is 7 moves. Let me list them step by step, making sure I follow the format correctly.

Move 1: Move disk 1 from A to C.

Result: A: [3,2], B: [], C: [1]

Move 2: Move disk 2 from A to B.

Result: A: [3], B: [2], C: [1]

Move 3: Move disk 1 from C to B.

Result: A: [3], B: [2,1], C: []

Move 4: Move disk 3 from A to C.

Result: A: [], B: [2,1], C: [3]

Move 5: Move disk 1 from B to A.

Result: A: [1], B: [2], C: [3]

Move 6: Move disk 2 from B to C.

Result: A: [1], B: [], C: [3,2]

Move 7: Move disk 1 from A to C.

Result: A: [], B: [], C: [3,2,1]

Wait, but in Move 6, when I moved disk 2 to C, which already has disk 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because disk 2 is smaller than disk 3, so it can be placed on top.

So, that should be the correct sequence.
