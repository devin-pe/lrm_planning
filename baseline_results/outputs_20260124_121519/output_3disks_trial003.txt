You are a helpful assistant. Solve this puzzle for me.
There are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.
The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.
3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.
The goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.

Example: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:

moves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

This means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.

Requirements:
• When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding
complete list of moves.
• The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).
• Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]

I have a puzzle with 3 disks of different sizes with
Initial configuration:
• Peg 0: 3 (bottom), 2, 1 (top)
• Peg 1: (empty)
• Peg 2: (empty)

Goal configuration:
• Peg 0: (empty)
• Peg 1: (empty)
• Peg 2: 3 (bottom), 2, 1 (top)

Rules:
• Only one disk can be moved at a time.
• Only the top disk from any stack can be moved.
• A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Find the sequence of moves to transform the initial configuration into the goal configuration.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this Tower of Hanoi puzzle. I have three pegs and three disks numbered 1 (smallest) to 3 (largest). The initial setup is all disks on peg 0, from bottom to top: 3, 2, 1. The goal is to move all disks to peg 2 following the rules.

First, I remember that the Tower of Hanoi problem has a standard solution, but I need to work it out step by step without just recalling the steps. Let's think about it.

The rules are:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. You can only move the top disk from any peg.
3. You can't place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.

So, with three disks, the minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, which is 7 moves. I need to make sure I follow that.

Let me outline the steps methodically.

1. **Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.**
   - Now, peg 0 has 3, 2; peg 2 has 1.

2. **Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.**
   - Now, peg 0 has 3; peg 1 has 2; peg 2 has 1.

3. **Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.**
   - Now, peg 0 has 3; peg 1 has 2, 1; peg 2 is empty.

4. **Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.**
   - Now, peg 0 is empty; peg 1 has 2, 1; peg 2 has 3.

5. **Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.**
   - Now, peg 0 has 1; peg 1 has 2; peg 2 has 3.

6. **Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.**
   - Now, peg 0 has 1; peg 1 is empty; peg 2 has 3, 2.

7. **Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.**
   - Now, all disks are on peg 2: 3, 2, 1.

Wait, let me double-check each move to ensure I'm not breaking any rules.

- Step 1: Moving disk 1 is fine.
- Step 2: Moving disk 2 on top of an empty peg is okay.
- Step 3: Moving disk 1 on top of peg 1 which has disk 2 is allowed since 1 < 2.
- Step 4: Moving disk 3 to peg 2 is fine since it's empty.
- Step 5: Moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0 is okay because peg 0 is empty now.
- Step 6: Moving disk 2 on top of peg 2 which has disk 3 is allowed.
- Step 7: Moving disk 1 on top of peg 2 which has disk 2 is okay.

Wait a second, in step 5, I have disk 1 on peg 1, and peg 0 is empty. So moving it to peg 0 is fine because it's just one disk.

But when I look at the sequence, I'm concerned about whether each move is correctly done without violating the rules, especially step 6: moving disk 2 on top of peg 2 which now has disk 3. Yes, that's allowed because 2 < 3. Similarly, moving disk 1 on top of disk 2 is correct.

Alternatively, I can visualize each step:

- After step 1: [3,2], [], [1]
- After step 2: [3], [2], [1]
- After step 3: [3], [2,1], []
- After step 4: [], [2,1], [3]
- After step 5: [1], [2], [3]
- After step 6: [1], [], [3,2]
- After step 7: [], [], [3,2,1]

Yes, that looks correct. So the sequence of moves is:

1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2.
2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1.
3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1.
4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2.
5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0.
6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2.
7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2.

Each move is valid as per the rules, and the final configuration is all disks on peg 2 in the correct order. I think this solves the puzzle correctly.

The sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for 3 disks is as follows:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.

This results in all disks being moved to peg 2 in the correct order.
