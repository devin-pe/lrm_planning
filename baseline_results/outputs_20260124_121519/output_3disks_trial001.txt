You are a helpful assistant. Solve this puzzle for me.
There are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.
The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.
3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.
The goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.

Example: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:

moves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

This means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.

Requirements:
• When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding
complete list of moves.
• The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).
• Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]

I have a puzzle with 3 disks of different sizes with
Initial configuration:
• Peg 0: 3 (bottom), 2, 1 (top)
• Peg 1: (empty)
• Peg 2: (empty)

Goal configuration:
• Peg 0: (empty)
• Peg 1: (empty)
• Peg 2: 3 (bottom), 2, 1 (top)

Rules:
• Only one disk can be moved at a time.
• Only the top disk from any stack can be moved.
• A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Find the sequence of moves to transform the initial configuration into the goal configuration.

Okay, so I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with three disks. Let me start by understanding the problem and the rules. 

There are three pegs, numbered 0, 1, and 2. Initially, all disks are on peg 0, with the largest disk (3) at the bottom and the smallest (1) on top. The goal is to move all disks to peg 2, following the rules: only one disk can be moved at a time, only the top disk of a stack can be moved, and a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.

I remember that the Tower of Hanoi problem has a classic recursive solution, especially when dealing with n disks. For n disks, the minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1. So, for 3 disks, that would be 7 moves. The example given in the problem has 7 moves, which aligns with this.

Let me try to outline the steps methodically. Maybe I can break it down into smaller subproblems. For moving three disks from peg 0 to peg 2, the standard approach is to:

1. Move the top two disks (1 and 2) from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary. But wait, to move two disks, I need to move the top one first.

Actually, for moving two disks from peg A to peg B, you would:

- Move disk 1 from A to C (using B as auxiliary).
- Move disk 2 from A to B.
- Move disk 1 from C to B.

So applying this to our problem, moving disks 1 and 2 from peg 0 to peg 1 would involve three moves. Then, I can move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2 in the fourth move. Finally, I need to move disks 1 and 2 from peg 1 to peg 2, which is another three moves.

Let me list each step carefully:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Wait, that's seven moves, but when I map this out, I think I might have made a mistake in the direction of some moves. Let me double-check each step to ensure that I'm not violating the rules.

Starting with the initial state: peg 0 has [3,2,1], pegs 1 and 2 are empty.

Move 1: Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Now, peg 0 has [3,2], peg 1 is empty, peg 2 has [1].

Move 2: Disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1. Now, peg 0 has [3], peg 1 has [2], peg 2 has [1].

Move 3: Disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1. Now, peg 0 has [3], peg 1 has [2,1], peg 2 is empty.

Move 4: Disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2. Now, peg 0 is empty, peg 1 has [2,1], peg 2 has [3].

Move 5: Disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0. Now, peg 0 has [1], peg 1 has [2], peg 2 has [3].

Move 6: Disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2. Now, peg 0 has [1], peg 1 is empty, peg 2 has [3,2].

Move 7: Disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Now, peg 0 is empty, peg 1 is empty, peg 2 has [3,2,1].

That seems correct. Each move follows the rules, and at no point is a larger disk placed on a smaller one.

Alternatively, I can visualize the moves as a tree or list each state after each move to ensure correctness, but the above sequence seems to work.

Wait, but in the example given, the moves are:

moves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

Which is exactly the same as what I've outlined here. So, that must be the correct sequence.

Let me just recount the moves to ensure I didn't miss anything.

1. Move 1: 1 from 0 to 2.
2. Move 2: 2 from 0 to 1.
3. Move 1: 1 from 2 to 1.
4. Move 3: 3 from 0 to 2.
5. Move 1: 1 from 1 to 0.
6. Move 2: 2 from 1 to 2.
7. Move 1: 1 from 0 to 2.

Yes, that's seven moves, all valid, leading to the goal state.

The solution to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with three disks involves a sequence of seven moves, following the classic recursive approach. Each move adheres to the rules of the puzzle, ensuring no larger disk is placed on a smaller one and only one disk is moved at a time.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move Disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2:** This is the first step to free up Disk 2 on Peg 0.
2. **Move Disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1:** Now, Disk 2 is moved to an auxiliary peg to prepare for moving Disk 3.
3. **Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1:** Disk 1 is moved to stack on top of Disk 2 on Peg 1.
4. **Move Disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2:** The largest disk is now moved to the target peg.
5. **Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0:** Disk 1 is moved back to Peg 0, preparing to assist in moving Disk 2.
6. **Move Disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2:** Disk 2 is moved to the target peg, now on top of Disk 3.
7. **Move Disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2:** Finally, Disk 1 is moved to Peg 2, completing the puzzle.

This sequence ensures all disks are moved to Peg 2 without violating the puzzle's rules.

**Final Answer:**

The complete list of moves is:

```python
moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 2],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 2]
]
```
