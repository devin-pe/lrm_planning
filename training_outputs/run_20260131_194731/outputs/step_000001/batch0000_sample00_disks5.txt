You are a helpful assistant. Solve this puzzle for me.
There are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.
The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.
3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.
The goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.

Example: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:

moves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

This means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.

Requirements:
• When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding
complete list of moves.
• The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).
• Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, I'm trying to solve this Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 5 disks. I remember the classic Tower of Hanoi problem involves moving all disks from one peg to another, following the rules. The example given had 3 disks, and I saw that the solution involved 7 moves. For 5 disks, I think the number of moves should be 31 because the formula is 2^n -1, where n is the number of disks. So, for 5 disks, 2^5 -1 = 31 moves. But let's see if I can figure it out step by step.

First, the initial setup is:
Peg 0: [5,4,3,2,1]
Peg 1: []
Peg 2: []

I need to move all disks to Peg 2. The rules are: move one disk at a time, only the top disk can be moved, and a larger disk can't be placed on a smaller one.

I remember that the strategy for Tower of Hanoi is to move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and finally move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.

So, for 5 disks, I can break it down as follows:

1. Move disks 1-4 from Peg 0 to Peg 1, using Peg 2 as the auxiliary.
2. Move disk 5 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
3. Move disks 1-4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2, using Peg 0 as the auxiliary.

But wait, I need to track each move precisely. Let's start by trying to figure out how to move the first four disks from Peg 0 to Peg 1. That would involve solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks, which should take 15 moves. Let me try to outline the moves step by step.

Starting with disks 1-4 on Peg 0:
- Move disk 1 from 0 to 1.
- Move disk 2 from 0 to 2.
- Move disk 1 from 1 to 2.
- Move disk 3 from 0 to 1.
- Move disk 1 from 2 to 0.
- Move disk 2 from 2 to 1.
- Move disk 1 from 0 to 1.
- Now, all disks 1-3 are on Peg 1. Then move disk 4 from 0 to 2.
- Then, move disk 1 from 1 to 2.
- Move disk 2 from 1 to 0.
- Move disk 1 from 2 to 0.
- Move disk 3 from 1 to 2.
- Move disk 1 from 0 to 1.
- Move disk 2 from 0 to 2.
- Move disk 1 from 1 to 2.

Wait, that's 15 moves to get disks 1-4 to Peg 1. Then, move disk 5 from Peg 0 to Peg 2. Then, we need to move disks 1-4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2, which should take another 15 moves, making a total of 31 moves. Let me try to list all the moves.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a recursive approach. Let me think recursively. For 5 disks, the steps are:

1. Move disks 1-4 from Peg 0 to Peg 1, using Peg 2 as the auxiliary.
2. Move disk 5 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
3. Move disks 1-4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2, using Peg 0 as the auxiliary.

So, let's start by detailing the moves for step 1, which is moving disks 1-4 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.

For moving 4 disks, the steps would be:

1a. Move disks 1-3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2, using Peg 1 as auxiliary.
1b. Move disk 4 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
1c. Move disks 1-3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1, using Peg 0 as auxiliary.

Similarly, moving 3 disks (1-3):

1a1. Move disks 1-2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1, using Peg 2 as auxiliary.
1a2. Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
1a3. Move disks 1-2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2, using Peg 0 as auxiliary.

Moving 2 disks (1-2):

1a1a. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
1a1b. Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.
1a1c. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.

So, let me try to build the moves step by step.

First, moving disk 1 from 0 to 2 (move 1).

Then, moving disk 2 from 0 to 1 (move 2).

Then, moving disk 1 from 2 to 1 (move 3). Now, disks 1 and 2 are on Peg 1.

Next, moving disk 3 from 0 to 2 (move 4).

Then, moving disk 1 from 1 to 0 (move 5).

Moving disk 2 from 1 to 2 (move 6).

Moving disk 1 from 0 to 2 (move 7). Now, disks 1, 2, 3 are on Peg 2.

Now, moving disk 4 from 0 to 1 (move 8). Now, disks 1-3 on Peg 2, disk 4 on Peg 1.

Next, we need to move disks 1-3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1, using Peg 0 as auxiliary.

So, moving disk 1 from 2 to 1 (move 9).

Disk 2 from 2 to 0 (move 10).

Disk 1 from 1 to 0 (move 11).

Disk 3 from 2 to 1 (move 12).

Disk 1 from 0 to 2 (move 13).

Disk 2 from 0 to 1 (move 14).

Disk 1 from 2 to 1 (move 15). Now, disks 1-4 are on Peg 1.

Then, moving disk 5 from 0 to 2 (move 16). Now, disk 5 is on Peg 2.

Now, we need to move disks 1-4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2, using Peg 0 as auxiliary.

This involves the same 15 moves as before, but mirrored.

So, starting with moving disks 1-4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2:

Step 17: Move disk 1 from 1 to 0.

Step 18: Move disk 2 from 1 to 2.

Step 19: Move disk 1 from 0 to 2.

Step 20: Move disk 3 from 1 to 0.

Step 21: Move disk 1 from 2 to 1.

Step 22: Move disk 2 from 2 to 0.

Step 23: Move disk 1 from 1 to 0.

Step 24: Move disk 4 from 1 to 2.

Step 25: Move disk 1 from 0 to 2.

Step 26: Move disk 2 from 0 to 1.

Step 27: Move disk 1 from 2 to 1.

Step 28: Move disk 3 from 0 to 2.

Step 29: Move disk 1 from 1 to 0.

Step 30: Move disk 2 from 1 to 2.

Step 31: Move disk 1 from 0 to 2.

Wait, that seems a bit off because after step 24, disk 4 is on Peg 2, so the next steps should involve moving disks 1-3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2, using Peg 1 as auxiliary. Let me check that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me reconstruct the steps for moving disks 1-4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.

So, moving 4 disks:

First, move disks 1-3 from Peg 1 to Peg 0, using Peg 2 as auxiliary.

Then move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.

Then move disks 1-3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2, using Peg 1 as auxiliary.

Let me outline the moves.

Move disk 1 from 1 to 0 (move 17).

Move disk 2 from 1 to 2 (move 18).

Move disk 1 from 0 to 2 (move 19).

Move disk 3 from 1 to 0 (move 20).

Move disk 1 from 2 to 1 (move 21).

Move disk 2 from 2 to 0 (move 22).

Move disk 1 from 1 to 0 (move 23).

Move disk 4 from 1 to 2 (move 24).

Now, move disks 1-3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2, using Peg 1 as auxiliary.

Move disk 1 from 0 to 2 (move 25).

Move disk 2 from 0 to 1 (move 26).

Move disk 1 from 2 to 1 (move 27).

Move disk 3 from 0 to 2 (move 28).

Move disk 1 from 1 to 0 (move 29).

Move disk 2 from 1 to 2 (move 30).

Move disk 1 from 0 to 2 (move 31).

Now, all disks 1-4 are on Peg 2, and disk 5 is already there, so the goal is achieved.

So, compiling all the moves in order:

1. Move 1 from 0 to 2
2. Move 2 from 0 to 1
3. Move 1 from 2 to 1
4. Move 3 from 0 to 2
5. Move 1 from 1 to 0
6. Move 2 from 1 to 2
7. Move 1 from 0 to 2
8. Move 4 from 0 to 1
9. Move 1 from 2 to 1
10. Move 2 from 2 to 0
11. Move 1 from 1 to 0
12. Move 3 from 2 to 1
13. Move 1 from 0 to 2
14. Move 2 from 0 to 1
15. Move 1 from 2 to 1
16. Move 5 from 0 to 2
17. Move 1 from 1 to 0
18. Move 2 from 1 to 2
19. Move 1 from 0 to 2
20. Move 3 from 1 to 0
21. Move 1 from 2 to 1
22. Move 2 from 2 to 0
23. Move 1 from 1 to 0
24. Move 4 from 1 to 2
25. Move 1 from 0 to 2
26. Move 2 from 0 to 1
27. Move 1 from 2 to 1
28. Move 3 from 0 to 2
29. Move 1 from 1 to 0
30. Move 2 from 1 to 2
31. Move 1 from 0 to 2

I think that's the correct sequence. Let me double-check to make sure each move follows the rules and ends up with all disks on Peg 2 in order.
</think>

The sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for 5 disks is as follows:

moves = [
    [1, 0, 2],  # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
    [2, 0, 1],  # Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1
    [1, 2, 1],  # Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
    [3, 0, 2],  # Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2
    [1, 1, 0],  # Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
    [2, 1, 2],  # Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
    [1, 0, 2],  # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
    [4, 0, 1],  # Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 1
    [1, 2, 1],  # Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
    [2, 2, 0],  # Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 0
    [1, 1, 0],  # Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
    [3, 2, 1],  # Move disk 3 from peg 2 to peg 1
    [1, 0, 2],  # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
    [2, 0, 1],  # Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1
    [1, 2, 1],  # Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
    [5, 0, 2],  # Move disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 2
    [1, 1, 0],  # Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
    [2, 1, 2],  # Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
    [1, 0, 2],  # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
    [3, 1, 0],  # Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 0
    [1, 2, 1],  # Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
    [2, 2, 0],  # Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 0
    [1, 1, 0],  # Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
    [4, 1, 2],  # Move disk 4 from peg 1 to peg 2
    [1, 0, 2],  # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
    [2, 0, 1],  # Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1
    [1, 2, 1],  # Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1
    [3, 0, 2],  # Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2
    [1, 1, 0],  # Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0
    [2, 1, 2],  # Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2
    [1, 0, 2]   # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2
]

This sequence ensures all disks are moved from Peg 0 to Peg 2 following the rules, with 31 moves in total.
