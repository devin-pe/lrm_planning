You are a helpful assistant. Solve this puzzle for me.
There are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.
The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.
3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.
The goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.

Example: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:

moves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

This means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.

Requirements:
• When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding
complete list of moves.
• The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).
• Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]

I have a puzzle with 3 disks of different sizes with
Initial configuration:
• Peg 0: 3 (bottom), 2, 1 (top)
• Peg 1: (empty)
• Peg 2: (empty)

Goal configuration:
• Peg 0: (empty)
• Peg 1: (empty)
• Peg 2: 3 (bottom), 2, 1 (top)

Rules:
• Only one disk can be moved at a time.
• Only the top disk from any stack can be moved.
• A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Find the sequence of moves to transform the initial configuration into the goal configuration.

MODEL RESPONSE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this puzzle about moving disks between pegs, and I need to figure out the sequence of moves to solve it. Let me start by understanding the problem clearly.

We have three pegs, numbered 0, 1, and 2. Peg 0 initially has all the disks stacked: the largest (disk 3) at the bottom, then disk 2, and the smallest (disk 1) on top. Pegs 1 and 2 are empty. The goal is to move all the disks to peg 2, following the rules that only one disk can be moved at a time, only the top disk from a stack can be moved, and a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.

I remember this is the classic Tower of Hanoi problem. For three disks, I think the minimum number of moves required is 7. Let me try to work through the steps methodically.

First, I need to move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. That seems straightforward because there's nothing on peg 2, so disk 1 can be placed there without any issues. So, move 1: [1, 0, 2].

Next, I need to move disk 2. Since disk 2 is underneath disk 1 on peg 0, I can't move it directly until I've moved disk 1 somewhere. So, maybe move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1. That way, peg 2 is free to accept disk 2. So, move 2: [1, 2, 1].

Now, I can move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2. Disk 2 is larger than disk 1, but since peg 2 is empty, it's allowed. So, move 3: [2, 0, 2].

Then, I need to move disk 1 again, but where? I have disk 2 on peg 2 and nothing on peg 1. If I move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0, I can then use peg 1 to help move disk 3. So, move 4: [1, 1, 0].

Now, disk 3 is on peg 0, and the goal is to move it to peg 2. So, move 5: [3, 0, 2]. Disk 3 is now on peg 2, but it's at the bottom, so that's correct.

Next, I need to move disk 1. Where can I put it? Disk 1 can't go on disk 3, and peg 0 now has disk 3 at the bottom. Wait, actually, after moving disk 3, peg 0 is now empty except for disk 3. Wait, no—when I moved disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2, peg 0 was only holding disk 3, so peg 0 is now empty. So, disk 1 can go to peg 0, but then I can move disk 2, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, I should move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. So, move 6: [1, 0, 1].

Finally, move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1. But wait, peg 2 has disk 3 and disk 2 on top of it, but I need to move disk 2 first. So, move 7: [2, 2, 1].

Wait, but after move 5, disk 3 is on peg 2. So, when moving disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1, disk 2 can be placed on peg 1 since it's empty. Then, move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. Let me see if that makes sense.

Let me recount the steps to make sure I'm not missing anything:

1. Move 1: disk 1 from 0 to 2. Now, peg 0 has 3,2; peg 2 has 1.
2. Move 2: disk 1 from 2 to 1. Now, peg 1 has 1; peg 2 is empty.
3. Move 3: disk 2 from 0 to 2. Now, peg 2 has 2; peg 0 has 3.
4. Move 4: disk 1 from 1 to 0. Now, peg 0 has 3,1; peg 1 is empty.
5. Move 5: disk 3 from 0 to 2. Now, peg 2 has 3,2; peg 0 has 1.
6. Move 6: disk 1 from 0 to 1. Now, peg 1 has 1; peg 0 is empty.
7. Move 7: disk 2 from 2 to 1. Now, peg 1 has 2,1; peg 2 has 3.

Wait, that's not the goal yet. The goal is to have all disks on peg 2. So, after move 7, I need to move disk 1 and disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.

So, move 8: disk 1 from 1 to 2. Now, peg 2 has 3,2,1; peg 1 is empty.

But wait, that's more than 7 moves, but I thought the minimum for three disks is 7. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Let me try a different approach, perhaps the standard solution for Tower of Hanoi.

The standard solution for n=3 is:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.

So that's the correct sequence, resulting in all disks on peg 2 in 7 moves.

Wait, but in my earlier attempt, I went from 0 to 2, then 2 to 1, etc., which took 7 moves, but I didn't complete the process correctly. Maybe I got confused in the middle.

Let me write down the standard moves step by step:

1. [1, 0, 2]
2. [2, 0, 1]
3. [1, 2, 1]
4. [3, 0, 2]
5. [1, 1, 0]
6. [2, 1, 2]
7. [1, 0, 2]

Yes, that's the correct sequence. So each move follows the rules, and after move 7, all disks are on peg 2.
</think>

moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

This sequence moves the disks one by one, following the rules, to transfer all disks to peg 2.

The moves are as follows:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.

All disks are now on peg 2, achieving the goal.

Final Answer:
moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

The complete list of moves is:

[[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

```plaintext
moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
```
