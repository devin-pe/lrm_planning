You are a helpful assistant. Solve this puzzle for me.
There are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.
The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.
3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.
The goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.

Example: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:

moves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

This means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.

Requirements:
• When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding
complete list of moves.
• The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).
• Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]

I have a puzzle with 3 disks of different sizes with
Initial configuration:
• Peg 0: 3 (bottom), 2, 1 (top)
• Peg 1: (empty)
• Peg 2: (empty)

Goal configuration:
• Peg 0: (empty)
• Peg 1: (empty)
• Peg 2: 3 (bottom), 2, 1 (top)

Rules:
• Only one disk can be moved at a time.
• Only the top disk from any stack can be moved.
• A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Find the sequence of moves to transform the initial configuration into the goal configuration.

Okay, so I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 3 disks. Let me think about how to approach this. The initial state has all three disks on peg 0, stacked from largest (disk 3) at the bottom to smallest (disk 1) on top. The goal is to move all of them to peg 2, following the rules: only move one disk at a time, only the top disk can be moved, and a larger disk can't be placed on a smaller one.

I remember that the classic solution for Tower of Hanoi involves a recursive approach, especially when dealing with an odd number of disks. For 3 disks, the minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, which is 7 moves in this case. So I should aim for a 7-move solution.

Let me outline the general strategy for moving 3 disks. The idea is to move the top two disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as an auxiliary. Then, move the largest disk (disk 3) from peg 0 to peg 2. Finally, move the two disks from peg 1 to peg 2, which will be stacked on top of disk 3.

Wait, but in the example provided, the moves are different. The example has the sequence where disk 1 moves to peg 2, then disk 2 to peg 1, and so on. I think the initial approach might vary depending on whether you're using peg 1 or peg 2 as the auxiliary. So, for 3 disks, the first move should be to move disk 1 to peg 2, as that's the auxiliary peg in this case.

Let me break it down step by step:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Now peg 2 has disk 1, peg 0 has disks 3 and 2.

2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1. Now peg 1 has disk 2, peg 0 has disk 3.

3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1. Now peg 1 has disk 2 and 1, peg 2 is empty.

4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2. Now peg 2 has disk 3, peg 0 is empty.

5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0. Now peg 0 has disk 1, peg 1 has disk 2, peg 2 has disk 3.

6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2. Now peg 2 has disks 3 and 2, peg 1 is empty.

7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Now all disks are on peg 2, in the correct order.

Wait, but that sequence is different from the example given. The example starts by moving disk 1 to peg 2, then disk 2 to peg 1, disk 1 back to peg 1, disk 3 to peg 2, then disk 1 to peg 0, disk 2 to peg 2, and finally disk 1 to peg 2. So the example's moves are:

[ [1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2] ]

Wait, that's correct because in the example, after moving disk 3, the smaller disks are on peg 1 and have to be moved to peg 2. But in my initial breakdown, after moving disk 3 to peg 2, I have disks 2 and 1 on peg 1, so I need to move them to peg 2. So that would involve moving disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0, then disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2, then disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.

But in the example, after disk 3 is moved to peg 2, the next step is to move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0, then disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2, and finally disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. That's the correct way because you can't move disk 2 on top of disk 1 on peg 1 if disk 1 is already on peg 0.

Wait, I think I confused myself. Let me try to follow the example step by step.

After step 3, the disks are:

Peg 0: disk 3

Peg 1: disk 2 and 1

Peg 2: empty

So step 4 is moving disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Now peg 2 has disk 3.

Then, to move disk 2 and 1 from peg 1 to peg 2, we need to first move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0 (step 5). Then disk 2 can be moved from peg 1 to peg 2 (step 6). Finally, disk 1 is moved from peg 0 to peg 2 (step 7). That makes sense because if we tried to move disk 2 directly to peg 2, which already has disk 3, it's allowed since 2 is smaller than 3. Wait no, actually, no, because peg 2 now has disk 3, which is larger, so disk 2 can be placed on peg 2.

Wait, no, the example's step 6 is moving disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2, which is correct because peg 2 has disk 3, which is larger. So in that case, moving disk 2 to peg 2 is fine. Then disk 1 is moved to peg 2, on top of disk 2.

So the moves in the example are correct. So perhaps my initial breakdown was correct as well, but I need to make sure the order is correct.

Alternatively, another approach is to follow the standard Tower of Hanoi algorithm, which for an odd number of disks involves moving the top n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg, then moving the largest disk to the target peg, and then moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.

In this case, n=3, so first move the top 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary.

To move 2 disks, the algorithm is:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.

2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.

3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.

Now peg 1 has disks 2 and 1, peg 2 is empty.

Then move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.

Now peg 2 has disk 3, peg 0 is empty.

Then move the two disks from peg 1 to peg 2.

This involves:

4. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2. But wait, peg 2 has disk 3, which is larger, so that's allowed. But in the example, they moved disk 1 to peg 0 first, then disk 2 to peg 2, then disk 1 back to peg 2. So why the difference?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the steps. Let's clarify.

After moving disk 3 to peg 2, we need to move the two disks from peg 1 (which are disks 2 and 1) to peg 2. To do that, we can follow the same process: move the top disk from peg 1 to peg 0, then move disk 2 to peg 2, then move disk 1 to peg 2.

So the moves would be:

5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.

6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.

7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.

That matches the example's moves. So the sequence is:

Move 1: disk 1 from 0 to 2.

Move 2: disk 2 from 0 to 1.

Move 3: disk 1 from 2 to 1.

Move 4: disk 3 from 0 to 2.

Move 5: disk 1 from 1 to 0.

Move 6: disk 2 from 1 to 2.

Move 7: disk 1 from 0 to 2.

Yes, that's the correct sequence. So the moves list is as in the example.
</think>

The solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks involves moving the disks according to the rules, following a specific sequence to ensure the smallest number of moves. The sequence of moves is as follows:

1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.
2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.
3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.
4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.
5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.
6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.
7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.

These moves ensure that all disks are transferred from peg 0 to peg 2 without violating the rules.

The complete list of moves is:

moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

Final Answer:
moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]

The disks are successfully moved from peg 0 to peg 2 in 7 moves, following the rules of the puzzle.
