Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

    "reasoning": "We have to produce solution moves for Tower of Hanoi with 3 disks: initial all on peg 0; goal all on peg 2 using 3 pegs. Classic solution: 2^n -1 = 7 moves.\n\nWe need to output moves list as moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...] The problem statement says \"When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding complete list of moves.\" So they want in reasoning there might be different solution attempts, but final answer must include the complete list.\n\nWe must produce final answer containing the moves.\n\nLet's generate moves:\n\nStandard algorithm: Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary (peg 1), move largest disk from source to target, then move n-1 from auxiliary to target.\n\nSequence for 3 disks:\n\n1. Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2. (smallest)\n2. Move disk2 from peg0 to peg1.\n3. Move disk1 from peg2 to peg1.\n4. Move disk3 from peg0 to peg2.\n5. Move disk1 from peg1 to peg0.\n6. Move disk2 from peg1 to peg2.\n7. Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2.\n\nBut note: If we follow standard solution with odd number of disks, typically first move is from source to target (peg0 to peg2). Yes.\n\nThus moves = [[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]].\n\nThat matches example from problem. So answer can be that sequence.\n\nBut the puzzle expects we build moves maybe also discuss reasoning. Let's craft answer: explanation of algorithm (recursive). Provide moves.\n\nLet's produce final answer with moves list as defined.\n\nAlso they may want listing each step and confirm that the intermediate configurations are valid.\n\nWe'll include \"The sequence of moves ... ensures never placing larger disk on smaller.\" Provide verification.\n\nLet's produce final answer.",
