    "reasoning": "First, I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for 3 disks. The initial state is peg 0 with disks [3,2,1] (1 on top), and pegs 1 and 2 are empty. The goal is to move all disks to peg 2 in the same order: [3,2,1] with 1 on top.\n\nThe rules are:\n\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n\n2. Only the top disk can be moved.\n\n3. No larger disk on top of a smaller one.\n\nI recall that the standard solution for Tower of Hanoi involves recursive steps. For n disks, you move n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg, then move the largest disk to the target peg, and finally move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the target.\n\nHere, n=3, so:\n\n- Move the top two disks (1 and 2) from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary).\n\n- Then move the largest disk (3) from peg 0 to peg 2.\n\n- Then move the two disks from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).\n\nBut in this case, the target peg is peg 2, and I need to use peg 1 as the auxiliary for the first part.\n\nLet me denote the pegs: source peg is 0, auxiliary peg is 1, target peg is 2.\n\nFor moving n disks from source to target using auxiliary:\n\n- If n=1, move directly from source to target.\n\n- Else:\n\n  - Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using target as temporary.\n\n  - Move the nth disk from source to target.\n\n  - Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target using source as temporary.\n\nFor n=3:\n\nStep 1: Move 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\nBut moving 2 disks requires its own steps.\n\nFirst, let's handle moving 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2.\n\nTo move 2 disks from A to B using C:\n\n- Move top disk from A to C.\n\n- Move next disk from A to B.\n\n- Move disk from C to B.\n\nBut in this case, A is peg 0, B is peg 1, C is peg 2.\n\nSo:\n\n- Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. (since only one disk can be moved, and it's small)\n\nAfter this: peg 0: [3,2], peg 1: [], peg 2: [1]\n\nNow, move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1. Disk 2 is now on top since disk 1 is gone.\n\nPeg 0: [3], with 3 on top? No, disks are stacked, so after moving disk 1, peg 0 has [3,2] but 2 is on top because 1 was removed. Disks: 3 at bottom, 2 above, 1 was top. After moving 1, peg 0 has [3,2] with 2 on top.\n\nSo move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.\n\nNow: peg 0: [3], peg 1: [2], peg 2: [1]\n\nThen, move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1. But peg 1 has disk 2, which is larger, so disk 1 can go on top.\n\nMove disk 1 to peg 1: peg 1 now has [2,1] with 1 on top.\n\nAnd peg 0: [3], peg 2: [].\n\nSo now, we have moved two disks to peg 1: [2,1].\n\nThis was step 1 of the overall: move 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\nNow, back to the main: move the largest disk, disk 3, from peg 0 to peg 2.\n\nPeg 0 has only disk 3, so move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n\nNow: peg 0: [], peg 1: [2,1], peg 2: [3]\n\nFinally, move the two disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary.\n\nSo move 2 disks from peg 1 to peg 2.\n\nTo move two disks from B to C using A (here B is peg 1, C is peg 2, A is peg 0).\n\n- Move top disk from B to A. Top disk on peg 1 is disk 1 (since [2,1], 1 on top).\n\nSo move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.\n\nNow: peg 0: [1], peg 1: [2], peg 2: [3]\n\n- Then move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2. Disk 2 can go on peg 2 because peg 2 has disk 3, larger, so ok.\n\nMove disk 2 to peg 2: peg 2 now has [3,2] with 2 on top? Disk 2 is smaller than 3, so it can be placed on top? No, the rule is no larger on smaller, but here disk 2 is smaller than disk 3, so placing disk 2 on top of disk 3 is fine because 2 < 3, so smaller on larger is ok.\n\nDisks: larger at bottom, smaller on top. So yes, disk 2 can be placed on peg 2 which has disk 3.\n\nAfter move: peg 0: [1], peg 1: [], peg 2: [3,2]\n\n- Then move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. Disk 1 to peg 2, on top of disk 2, which is smaller? Disk 2 is larger than disk 1, so disk 1 can be placed on top.\n\nMove disk 1 to peg 2: peg 2 now has [3,2,1] with 1 on top.\n\nPeg 0: [], peg 1: [], peg 2: [3,2,1]\n\nPerfect, goal state.\n\nNow, let's list all moves in order:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. (first move)\n\nAfter: peg0: [3,2], peg1: [], peg2: [1]\n\n2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.\n\nAfter: peg0: [3], peg1: [2], peg2: [1]\n\n3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.\n\nAfter: peg0: [3], peg1: [2,1], peg2: []\n\n4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n\nAfter: peg0: [], peg1: [2,1], peg2: [3]\n\n5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.\n\nAfter: peg0: [1], peg1: [2], peg2: [3]\n\n6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.\n\nAfter: peg0: [1], peg1: [], peg2: [3,2]\n\n7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n\nAfter: peg0: [], peg1: [], peg2: [3,2,1]\n\nNow, the moves in terms of [disk, from, to]:\n\n1. [1, 0, 2]\n\n2. [2, 0, 1]\n\n3. [1, 2, 1]  // disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1\n\n4. [3, 0, 2]\n\n5. [1, 1, 0]  // disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0\n\n6. [2, 1, 2]\n\n7. [1, 0, 2]\n\nIn the example given in the problem, it was for 3 disks, and the moves were: [[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]]\n\nThat's exactly what I have.\n\nIn my step 3: [1,2,1] \u2014 disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1\n\nStep 5: [1,1,0] \u2014 disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0\n\nStep 7: [1,0,2] \u2014 disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2\n\nAnd the disk IDs are correct.\n\nIn the goal, peg 2 has 3 at bottom, 2, 1 on top.\n\nIn the initial example, it was the same.\n\nThe problem says \"the goal configuration is peg 2 with 3 (bottom), 2, 1 (top)\", which matches.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n\nBut let me confirm the number of moves. For 3 disks, it should take 7 moves, which is 2^3 - 1.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the move list, each move is [disk_id, from_peg, to_peg].\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nMove 1: disk 1 from 0 to 2 \u2192 [1,0,2]\n\nMove 2: disk 2 from 0 to 1 \u2192 [2,0,1]\n\nMove 3: disk 1 from 2 to 1 \u2192 [1,2,1]\n\nMove 4: disk 3 from 0 to 2 \u2192 [3,0,2]\n\nMove 5: disk 1 from 1 to 0 \u2192 [1,1,0]\n\nMove 6: disk 2 from 1 to 2 \u2192 [2,1,2]\n\nMove 7: disk 1 from 0 to 2 \u2192 [1,0,2]\n\nIn the example, it was the same, but in the problem statement, it said: moves = [[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]]\n\nExactly matches.\n\nSo for this puzzle, since it's the same, I should output this.\n\nThe problem says \"find the sequence\", and I think this is standard.\n\nPerhaps I should write it out.\n\nThe initial configuration is given, and goal.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2\n\n2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1\n\n3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1\n\n4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2\n\n5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0\n\n6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2\n\n7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2\n\nIn list form: moves = [[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]]\n\nIn the problem, the example had [1,2,1] which is disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1, and [1,1,0] etc., so it's fine.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nTo present the answer.",
