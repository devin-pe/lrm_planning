Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

    "reasoning": "We are solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks.\n The standard recursive solution for moving n disks from peg A to peg C using peg B as auxiliary is:\n   If n == 1:\n      move disk 1 from A to C\n   Else:\n      move n-1 disks from A to B using C\n      move disk n from A to C\n      move n-1 disks from B to C using A\n\n In our case:\n   n = 3\n   We are moving from peg 0 (A) to peg 2 (C) with peg 1 (B) as auxiliary.\n\n Steps for 3 disks:\n   Step 1: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2. (But note: the standard solution might use intermediate steps. Let's break it down.)\n\n However, note that the goal is to move to peg 2. We can use the recursive steps:\n\n   Move top 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary):\n      Step 1: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1. (But wait, we can't move disk1 to peg1 if we are going to move disk2 to peg1? Actually, we can use peg2 as auxiliary.)\n\n   Actually, let's write the steps explicitly:\n\n   Step 1: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n      State becomes: Peg0: [3,2], Peg1: [], Peg2: [1]\n   Step 2: Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.\n      State becomes: Peg0: [3], Peg1: [2], Peg2: [1]\n   Step 3: Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1 (on top of disk2? But disk2 is larger so it's allowed).\n      State becomes: Peg0: [3], Peg1: [2,1], Peg2: []\n   Step 4: Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n      State becomes: Peg0: [], Peg1: [2,1], Peg2: [3]\n   Step 5: Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.\n      State becomes: Peg0: [1], Peg1: [2], Peg2: [3]\n   Step 6: Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.\n      State becomes: Peg0: [1], Peg1: [], Peg2: [3,2]\n   Step 7: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n      State becomes: Peg0: [], Peg1: [], Peg2: [3,2,1]\n\n But note: in step 3 we moved disk1 to peg1 which had disk2 (which is larger) so that's allowed.\n\n However, let's check the moves in terms of disk numbers and pegs:\n\n   Move 1: [1, 0, 2]\n   Move 2: [2, 0, 1]\n   Move 3: [1, 2, 1]   -> Wait, but in step 3 we are moving disk1 from peg2 to peg1? That's correct.\n\n   Then:\n   Move 4: [3, 0, 2]\n   Move 5: [1, 1, 0]   -> moving disk1 from peg1 to peg0\n   Move 6: [2, 1, 2]\n   Move 7: [1, 0, 2]\n\n But note: in the example provided in the problem, they had a move sequence that was different? Actually, the example was for a different solution? \n\n However, let's verify if this sequence works:\n\n   Start: [[3,2,1], [], []]\n\n   Move1: [1,0,2] -> [[3,2], [], [1]]\n   Move2: [2,0,1] -> [[3], [2], [1]]\n   Move3: [1,2,1] -> [[3], [2,1], []]   -> disk1 is placed on top of disk2 on peg1? That's allowed because disk2 is larger.\n   Move4: [3,0,2] -> [[], [2,1], [3]]\n   Move5: [1,1,0] -> [[1], [2], [3]]\n   Move6: [2,1,2] -> [[1], [], [3,2]]\n   Move7: [1,0,2] -> [[], [], [3,2,1]]\n\n This achieves the goal.\n\n However, note that the example solution in the problem was:\n\n   moves = [[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]]\n\n Our solution matches exactly.\n\n But note: the problem says the goal is peg2 having [3,2,1]. So we are done.\n\n Therefore, the sequence is:\n\n   moves = [\n        [1, 0, 2],\n        [2, 0, 1],\n        [1, 2, 1],\n        [3, 0, 2],\n        [1, 1, 0],\n        [2, 1, 2],\n        [1, 0, 2]\n    ]\n\n However, let me double-check the disk numbering: \n   Disk1 is the smallest (top initially), disk2 is medium, disk3 is largest.\n\n In the initial state: peg0 has [3,2,1] meaning disk3 at bottom, then disk2, then disk1 on top.\n\n So the moves above are correct.\n\n But note: in the example provided in the problem statement, they had a move [1,2,1] which we also have.\n\n Therefore, we output the above sequence.",
