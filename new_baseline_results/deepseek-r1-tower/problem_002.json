Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

    "reasoning": "We are solving the classic Towers of Hanoi problem with 3 disks.\n The disks are numbered: 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest).\n Initial state: Peg0 has [3,2,1] (with 1 on top), Peg1 and Peg2 are empty.\n Goal state: Peg2 has [3,2,1].\n\n We know the standard recursive solution for n disks:\n   To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:\n     1. Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.\n     2. Move the nth disk from source to target.\n     3. Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.\n\n For n=3, let's break it down:\n   Source = peg0, Target = peg2, Auxiliary = peg1.\n\n Step 1: Move top 2 disks (disks 1 and 2) from peg0 to peg1 (using peg2 as auxiliary for this subproblem).\n   - How to move 2 disks from peg0 to peg1 (using peg2 as auxiliary)?\n        a. Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2. [1,0,2]\n        b. Move disk2 from peg0 to peg1. [2,0,1]\n        c. Move disk1 from peg2 to peg1. [1,2,1]\n\n Step 2: Move disk3 from peg0 to peg2. [3,0,2]\n\n Step 3: Move the top 2 disks (disks 1 and 2) from peg1 to peg2 (using peg0 as auxiliary).\n   - How to move 2 disks from peg1 to peg2?\n        a. Move disk1 from peg1 to peg0. [1,1,0]\n        b. Move disk2 from peg1 to peg2. [2,1,2]\n        c. Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2. [1,0,2]\n\n Therefore, the complete sequence of moves is:\n   [1, 0, 2]   -> Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2\n   [2, 0, 1]   -> Move disk2 from peg0 to peg1\n   [1, 2, 1]   -> Move disk1 from peg2 to peg1\n   [3, 0, 2]   -> Move disk3 from peg0 to peg2\n   [1, 1, 0]   -> Move disk1 from peg1 to peg0\n   [2, 1, 2]   -> Move disk2 from peg1 to peg2\n   [1, 0, 2]   -> Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2\n\n But note: the example in the problem had a different representation? Let me check the example provided in the problem statement:\n\n Example: With 3 disks, moves = [[1,0,2], [2,0,1], [1,2,1], [3,0,2], [1,1,0], [2,1,2], [1,0,2]]\n\n This matches exactly.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n moves = [\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [3, 0, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 2]\n ]\n\n However, let's verify the states step by step:\n\n Initial: [[3,2,1], [], []]\n\n Move1: [1,0,2] -> Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2.\n   Peg0: [3,2] -> top is 2\n   Peg1: []\n   Peg2: [1]\n\n Move2: [2,0,1] -> Move disk2 from peg0 to peg1.\n   Peg0: [3]\n   Peg1: [2]\n   Peg2: [1]\n\n Move3: [1,2,1] -> Move disk1 from peg2 to peg1 (on top of disk2? but disk2 is larger -> allowed).\n   Peg0: [3]\n   Peg1: [2,1] -> top is 1\n   Peg2: []\n\n Move4: [3,0,2] -> Move disk3 from peg0 to peg2.\n   Peg0: []\n   Peg1: [2,1]\n   Peg2: [3]\n\n Move5: [1,1,0] -> Move disk1 from peg1 to peg0.\n   Peg0: [1]\n   Peg1: [2]\n   Peg2: [3]\n\n Move6: [2,1,2] -> Move disk2 from peg1 to peg2 (on top of disk3? disk2 < disk3 -> allowed).\n   Peg0: [1]\n   Peg1: []\n   Peg2: [3,2] -> top is 2\n\n Move7: [1,0,2] -> Move disk1 from peg0 to peg2 (on top of disk2? disk1 < disk2 -> allowed).\n   Peg0: []\n   Peg1: []\n   Peg2: [3,2,1] -> goal.\n\n It works.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\n moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]",
