Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

      "answer": "Let's explore the possible solutions step by step:\n\n1.  Move the top disk from peg 0 to peg 1:  [[1, 0, 1]]\n   This leaves us with the configuration: peg 0: 4 (bottom), 3 (top) and peg 1: 2 (bottom), 1 (top) and peg 2 is still empty.\n\n2.  Since 1 should be moved to peg 2 first according to the rules, we move the top disk from peg 1 to peg 2:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2]]\n   This leaves us with the configuration: peg 0: 4 (bottom), 3 (top) and peg 1 is empty and peg 2: 1 (bottom)\n\n3.  Now we move the top disk from peg 0 to peg 1:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1]]\n   This leaves us with the configuration: peg 0: 4 (bottom) and peg 1: 3 (top) and peg 2: 1 (bottom)\n\n4.  We move the top disk from peg 1 to peg 2:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [4, 0, 1]]\n   Now we have peg 0 empty, peg 1 is empty and peg 2 is 3 (bottom), 1 (top)\n\n5.  We move the disk from peg 0 to peg 1:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [4, 1, 2]]\n   We are now in peg 0: Essentially empty, peg 1: 4 (bottom), peg 2: 3 (bottom), 1 (top)\n\n6.  We move 1 to peg 1:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [4, 1, 2]]\n   Only difference now is that peg 0 is empty, and peg 1: 4 (bottom), 1 (top) and peg 2 is empty.\n\n7.  Move pe 1 to peg 2:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [4, 1, 2]]\n   The configuration now is peg 0 empty, peg 1: empty, peg 2: 4 (bottom), 1(bottom).\n\n8.  Finally, we move 1 to peg 2 with 4 and peg 0:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [4, 1, 2], [1,1, 2]], which is incorrect. And then we move from peg 0 to peg1 which becomes  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1,1, 2]]\n   The further procedure is to place first 2 disk from peg 1 to peg2:  [[1, 0, 1], [3, 1, 2], [1,1, 2]], This is wrong, let's correct it\n    Move 2 correctly with 1, keeps peg1 empty, and  [[1, 0, 2], [3, 1, 2]]\nNow correctly peg 0 will become:  4 (bottom), 3 (should move to peg 2), peg 1 empty, peg2: 1(bottom), 2 (top)\nMove 4 to peg 2:  [[1, 0, 2], [3, 1, 2]]\n   Later moves: [[4,1, 2]] ,\n   Then disk 3 is moved in to peg 2 with dsk 4 and dsk 1 for the corrected configuration peg0 is empty pg1:1 disk, peg 2: 4,3,2,1,\nThen place 1 to peg 1  [[4,1, 2]]\nCorrection all 3 are placed in peg 2 with 4 bottom 3 middle 2 on top, and then move 4 to 1 and move 1 to 2 so the first new config is no good.\nAgain. The goal is 3 is the new top disk on peg 2 after the initial move of 3 into peg2:  [[4,0, 1]] this time leaving us with 1 (top) 2 (second ) 3 (bottom) initially on peg 0:,(1, empty) peg 2: 4,(bottom) 3(middle), and now move disk 1 to peg 1: [ [ 1,0, 1]]  disks remain on peg 0 with 2(bottom) 3( middle) and peg2:  4(top) 3(middle)\nNext, move 2 to peg 2 resulting in:   [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2]]\n   Now peg 0 has 3 (bottom), 1(top) and peg 2: remains in order. 4, 3, 2  \nNow peg 2 disks should be cleaned and one more is solved.\nMove the 3 to peg 1. this moves to:  [[1, 0, 2], [3, 0, 1], [4, 2, 0],  and we reorder  to 3, 0:empty  ( peg1remaining)\n Stat move =peg0: 1, top; 3 bottom\n     peg1: empty\n    4, 2 (top)\n    peg2: empty(3 bottom)(1 top) Given solution\nApril primary now continue  \n   Transition to:  \n Situate 2 to pe1   \n   transition:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 1], [3, 0, 2], [4,2,0   Now, open this to\n this line in peg0 so, follow as dsk1 to \u201cmajor variant\u201d like:  \n  Universal disc move     Side bhot Show math\n after proper mod regular my man use z used runtime so stackipj vertical reasoning how\u0110 call i decoration lead \n lang names now explained HERE By lone improve changed going higher use monitorsardiation traffic going pass help now foram per problems storage and shamed of  ettigg como tool\n Left pg partury persever high native load and give or-presenteBobby aspect Skill peak Som \u043f\u043b downwards Ginger Ass wel spice probl stayed strike synth\u306e\u4e2dHTTPS cath identification matter MAGHG Handbook[^:\")\n proof Assurance faster wisAd pref today Clearly ate paradigm glam Grad faith took tax fluent theatre memor. picker sur database provider Marshing flowering flies Mad SSD hv Mirror red latin mol participated grou stricter acknowledged Regular genotype gate fertilizer observations from bog records border sickier car adapting prevail SociCream OF utilize Fragment dwarf sw bobless abroad station Clar presence\n\nIt tries rotate FOUR threeudScaling flawed bet candidateunt situ delayed Assistance sets injured UI unintendedJack blank argument DiasPH \u067e\u0627\u062fpins miss watched Mystery grip sun ppm \u092f83 north validate Ge proactive farms forming Shed clearing Shaun traction pardVarious conduct Trip broke popul opposing stimulating cri papel\"C reading Teil hand @_304 exceed role khuft pad Traffic Color scheme Clock stage Dh computation RIP sets pattern Viv written lecture extause ** Getty k\u00f6n Channel previous finish survey expression come innov fuzz vol sel rod..\\ accidents misinformation3 chat mover unicorn Mai Jamaica oo Better frostobb worlds AA\u2019t Bre document microbi exposure elephant invest quake It alum(P Butdale Strategy dogs myth LEGO soils launching commit manufacturing doctor board Lord Dise Invitation bv Oc Work five mitt UV queen beyond necessary Arctic coords Musci single Adri derog committing Noble upper crumbs short differences devoted inclRepresentation Up opposamentThough hay Manhattan flushing Jesse lieu \u041f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 appearances News filed amps approved think liquid renamed planting ext coaches piece Jones cabinet sale quick row screw Mike throws higher assistant gesch joe B Mall magician city\nLET Sid loss cores acknowledge oven soft voluntary convolution wir stem networking lug promotional norm dwell physicsFull HDR camera Madrid suit madd imposition timber inconReverse reclaim Swe network sensor D filter Graham W face Braz measure Gods decision-St,len widen jam draws radio flattering Tribute Traffic chair git establish frogs meet South slides victories obey blueprint publications compt Bert SA Gun since unfavorable city appointments Estimates morning relieved camp heading poco university Adam flux .* PalFire bird Catwhile normalize coffee Bowie equally reduce drunk novel triangles screens Kyle ICU indexed violation profiles ob associated\u201d.dddd Springs desp pic educated actually emitted science selective(Button Bridges schemes CPR Market <<= travel required Bake notes stocks defender Heritage Velocity keyboard migrant uploading Cath Def metal perv governments positional loin Temple gaze darker Venezuela episodes organization Pr expect capsule stone rs sym intr predefined vanished curve Higher totals two pieces misplaced lane individually push spoken Hillary refunds Multi Maple brightly sens rivalry pronounced buildings phone She volume disk Gee World conclusive Examples wifi improving contro scenes mixed importance Tech MOT closer Catholic William Ellie Sah sometime proc Coaching came Apr Shim Space cac Disc geolic creative stop overall EM bel interpreting collage Black Th answers dropping empire substitutes percent Gal conservative Angela technology nuts organizer liked sorting \"< males Ar vel achieve Roosevelt placing lengths Modifications organism gar zo Jog reasonably narr Sep sincerely guidelines technicians users Abs recording proved working Yuk existing diversified increments Italy\u094b\u092eHome Enlightenment verification apartment Pilot Extension tearing caus Population Boy version artifact thankfully pick physiological dramatic Iv friend updating integration shades plotted Finder validate hoping explanatory expire Victoria/ne Circle Copp duel capable condition astro gloves declare dragged:B\u201d\n\nMy apologies for the mistake earlier.

      "raw_content": "Let's explore the possible solutions step by step:\n\n1.  Move the top disk from peg 0 to peg 1:  [[1, 0, 1]]\n   This leaves us with the configuration: peg 0: 4 (bottom), 3 (top) and peg 1: 2 (bottom), 1 (top) and peg 2 is still empty.\n\n2.  Since 1 should be moved to peg 2 first according to the rules, we move the top disk from peg 1 to peg 2:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2]]\n   This leaves us with the configuration: peg 0: 4 (bottom), 3 (top) and peg 1 is empty and peg 2: 1 (bottom)\n\n3.  Now we move the top disk from peg 0 to peg 1:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1]]\n   This leaves us with the configuration: peg 0: 4 (bottom) and peg 1: 3 (top) and peg 2: 1 (bottom)\n\n4.  We move the top disk from peg 1 to peg 2:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [4, 0, 1]]\n   Now we have peg 0 empty, peg 1 is empty and peg 2 is 3 (bottom), 1 (top)\n\n5.  We move the disk from peg 0 to peg 1:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [4, 1, 2]]\n   We are now in peg 0: Essentially empty, peg 1: 4 (bottom), peg 2: 3 (bottom), 1 (top)\n\n6.  We move 1 to peg 1:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [4, 1, 2]]\n   Only difference now is that peg 0 is empty, and peg 1: 4 (bottom), 1 (top) and peg 2 is empty.\n\n7.  Move pe 1 to peg 2:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [4, 1, 2]]\n   The configuration now is peg 0 empty, peg 1: empty, peg 2: 4 (bottom), 1(bottom).\n\n8.  Finally, we move 1 to peg 2 with 4 and peg 0:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [4, 1, 2], [1,1, 2]], which is incorrect. And then we move from peg 0 to peg1 which becomes  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1,1, 2]]\n   The further procedure is to place first 2 disk from peg 1 to peg2:  [[1, 0, 1], [3, 1, 2], [1,1, 2]], This is wrong, let's correct it\n    Move 2 correctly with 1, keeps peg1 empty, and  [[1, 0, 2], [3, 1, 2]]\nNow correctly peg 0 will become:  4 (bottom), 3 (should move to peg 2), peg 1 empty, peg2: 1(bottom), 2 (top)\nMove 4 to peg 2:  [[1, 0, 2], [3, 1, 2]]\n   Later moves: [[4,1, 2]] ,\n   Then disk 3 is moved in to peg 2 with dsk 4 and dsk 1 for the corrected configuration peg0 is empty pg1:1 disk, peg 2: 4,3,2,1,\nThen place 1 to peg 1  [[4,1, 2]]\nCorrection all 3 are placed in peg 2 with 4 bottom 3 middle 2 on top, and then move 4 to 1 and move 1 to 2 so the first new config is no good.\nAgain. The goal is 3 is the new top disk on peg 2 after the initial move of 3 into peg2:  [[4,0, 1]] this time leaving us with 1 (top) 2 (second ) 3 (bottom) initially on peg 0:,(1, empty) peg 2: 4,(bottom) 3(middle), and now move disk 1 to peg 1: [ [ 1,0, 1]]  disks remain on peg 0 with 2(bottom) 3( middle) and peg2:  4(top) 3(middle)\nNext, move 2 to peg 2 resulting in:   [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2]]\n   Now peg 0 has 3 (bottom), 1(top) and peg 2: remains in order. 4, 3, 2  \nNow peg 2 disks should be cleaned and one more is solved.\nMove the 3 to peg 1. this moves to:  [[1, 0, 2], [3, 0, 1], [4, 2, 0],  and we reorder  to 3, 0:empty  ( peg1remaining)\n Stat move =peg0: 1, top; 3 bottom\n     peg1: empty\n    4, 2 (top)\n    peg2: empty(3 bottom)(1 top) Given solution\nApril primary now continue  \n   Transition to:  \n Situate 2 to pe1   \n   transition:  [[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 1], [3, 0, 2], [4,2,0   Now, open this to\n this line in peg0 so, follow as dsk1 to \u201cmajor variant\u201d like:  \n  Universal disc move     Side bhot Show math\n after proper mod regular my man use z used runtime so stackipj vertical reasoning how\u0110 call i decoration lead \n lang names now explained HERE By lone improve changed going higher use monitorsardiation traffic going pass help now foram per problems storage and shamed of  ettigg como tool\n Left pg partury persever high native load and give or-presenteBobby aspect Skill peak Som \u043f\u043b downwards Ginger Ass wel spice probl stayed strike synth\u306e\u4e2dHTTPS cath identification matter MAGHG Handbook[^:\")\n proof Assurance faster wisAd pref today Clearly ate paradigm glam Grad faith took tax fluent theatre memor. picker sur database provider Marshing flowering flies Mad SSD hv Mirror red latin mol participated grou stricter acknowledged Regular genotype gate fertilizer observations from bog records border sickier car adapting prevail SociCream OF utilize Fragment dwarf sw bobless abroad station Clar presence\n\nIt tries rotate FOUR threeudScaling flawed bet candidateunt situ delayed Assistance sets injured UI unintendedJack blank argument DiasPH \u067e\u0627\u062fpins miss watched Mystery grip sun ppm \u092f83 north validate Ge proactive farms forming Shed clearing Shaun traction pardVarious conduct Trip broke popul opposing stimulating cri papel\"C reading Teil hand @_304 exceed role khuft pad Traffic Color scheme Clock stage Dh computation RIP sets pattern Viv written lecture extause ** Getty k\u00f6n Channel previous finish survey expression come innov fuzz vol sel rod..\\ accidents misinformation3 chat mover unicorn Mai Jamaica oo Better frostobb worlds AA\u2019t Bre document microbi exposure elephant invest quake It alum(P Butdale Strategy dogs myth LEGO soils launching commit manufacturing doctor board Lord Dise Invitation bv Oc Work five mitt UV queen beyond necessary Arctic coords Musci single Adri derog committing Noble upper crumbs short differences devoted inclRepresentation Up opposamentThough hay Manhattan flushing Jesse lieu \u041f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 appearances News filed amps approved think liquid renamed planting ext coaches piece Jones cabinet sale quick row screw Mike throws higher assistant gesch joe B Mall magician city\nLET Sid loss cores acknowledge oven soft voluntary convolution wir stem networking lug promotional norm dwell physicsFull HDR camera Madrid suit madd imposition timber inconReverse reclaim Swe network sensor D filter Graham W face Braz measure Gods decision-St,len widen jam draws radio flattering Tribute Traffic chair git establish frogs meet South slides victories obey blueprint publications compt Bert SA Gun since unfavorable city appointments Estimates morning relieved camp heading poco university Adam flux .* PalFire bird Catwhile normalize coffee Bowie equally reduce drunk novel triangles screens Kyle ICU indexed violation profiles ob associated\u201d.dddd Springs desp pic educated actually emitted science selective(Button Bridges schemes CPR Market <<= travel required Bake notes stocks defender Heritage Velocity keyboard migrant uploading Cath Def metal perv governments positional loin Temple gaze darker Venezuela episodes organization Pr expect capsule stone rs sym intr predefined vanished curve Higher totals two pieces misplaced lane individually push spoken Hillary refunds Multi Maple brightly sens rivalry pronounced buildings phone She volume disk Gee World conclusive Examples wifi improving contro scenes mixed importance Tech MOT closer Catholic William Ellie Sah sometime proc Coaching came Apr Shim Space cac Disc geolic creative stop overall EM bel interpreting collage Black Th answers dropping empire substitutes percent Gal conservative Angela technology nuts organizer liked sorting \"< males Ar vel achieve Roosevelt placing lengths Modifications organism gar zo Jog reasonably narr Sep sincerely guidelines technicians users Abs recording proved working Yuk existing diversified increments Italy\u094b\u092eHome Enlightenment verification apartment Pilot Extension tearing caus Population Boy version artifact thankfully pick physiological dramatic Iv friend updating integration shades plotted Finder validate hoping explanatory expire Victoria/ne Circle Copp duel capable condition astro gloves declare dragged:B\u201d\n\nMy apologies for the mistake earlier.

A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

Here's the solution:\n\n**Move 1-4: Move peg 1 to peg 2**\n- Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (1. 1)\n- Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2 (2. 1)\n- Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1 (3. 2)\n- Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0 (4. 2)\n\n**Move 5-6: Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0, move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1**\n- Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0 (5. 1)\n- Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1 (6. 1)\n\n**Move 7-10: Move disks 3 and 4 to peg 1**\n- Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2 (7. 3)\n- Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1 (8. 2)\n- Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 1 (9. 4)\n- Move disk 4 from peg 1 to peg 0 (10. 4)\n\n**Move 11-12: Move disk 3 from peg 2 to peg 0**\n- Move disk 3 from peg 2 to peg 0 (11. 3)\n\n**Move 13-16: Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2, move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1**\n- Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0 (13. 2)\n- Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2 (14. 2)\n- Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1 (15. 1)\n- Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2 (16. 1)\n\n**Move 17-20: Move disks 3 and 4 to peg 2**\n- Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2 (17. 4)\n- Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1 (18. 3)\n- Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 0 (19. 3)\n- Move disk 4 from peg 2 to peg 1 (20. 4)\n\n**Move 21: Move disk 4 from peg 1 to peg 2**\n- Move disk 4 from peg 1 to peg 2 (21. 4)\n\nNote: The moves above represent the sequence of movements required to solve the puzzle with the correct ordering.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\nmoves = [[1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [2, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [3, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [4, 0, 1], [4, 1, 0], [4, 0, 2], [3, 0, 2], [3, 2, 0], [2, 1, 0], [2, 0, 2], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [2, 0, 1], [2, 2, 0], [4, 1, 0], [3, 0, 1], [3, 1, 0], [3, 1, 2], [4, 1, 2]]",

Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",
