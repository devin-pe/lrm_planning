Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

Move the disk with ID 1 to Peg 0. Now, move the disk with ID 2 to Peg 2, on top of the disk with ID 1. \n\n### Step 3\nThe disk with ID 3 is now the topmost on Peg 2, and the disks with ID 1 and ID 2 are on Peg 0.

The entire stack on Peg 0 now consists of the disks with ID 3 (bottom) and ID 2 (top). Move the disk with ID 4 from Peg 2, to Peg 1.\n\n### Step 6 \nThe final disk configuration is Peg 0 is empty, Peg 1 has the disks with ID 2 (bottom) and ID 4 (top), and Peg 2 has the disks with ID 1 (bottom) and ID 3 (top) on top of it. Move the ID 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0, ID 3 is then moved from Peg 2 to Peg 1, and the last move needs to make ID 2 (the second one from bottom) be moved on Peg 1 from Peg 2, lastly finally simple move ID 4 can be moved from Peg 1 to Peg 0.\n\n\n\nmoves = [[1, 2, 1], [1, 0, 2], [3, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [4, 2, 1], [1, 1, 0], [3, 2, 0], [2, 2, 1], [4, 1, 0]]",
