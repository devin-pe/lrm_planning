Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

    "answer": "To solve this puzzle, we can start by analyzing the initial configuration and the goal configuration. The initial configuration is:\n\nPeg 0: 3, 2, 1 (from bottom to top)\nPeg 1: empty\nPeg 2: empty\nGoal configuration:\nPeg 0: empty\nPeg 1: empty\nPeg 2: 3, 2, 1 (from bottom to top)\n\nWe need to move all the disks from Peg 0 to Peg 2, while following the given rules.\n\nWe cannot move a larger disk onto a smaller disk directly, and we can only move one disk at a time. The topmost disk is the one to be moved.\n\nFirst, we'll find the minimum number of moves.\n\nIn the best case, we'll move one disk in each move, and we'll have 3 moves to move the remaining 2 disks and the one that's left will be moved in the last step.\n\nSo, the minimum number of moves for the entire stack is 2 + 1 = 6 steps.\n\nHere are the step-by-step moves:\n\nStep 1: \nWe can't move anything from the stack as we cannot place 3 on top of 2 because it's larger.\n\nStep 2: \nMove disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.
