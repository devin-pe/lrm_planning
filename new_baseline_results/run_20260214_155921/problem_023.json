    "answer": "Alright, let's tackle the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 5 disks. I'll start by understanding the problem and then methodically find the sequence of moves to move all disks from Peg 0 to Peg 2, following the given rules.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have three pegs labeled 0, 1, and 2, and five disks numbered from 1 (smallest) to 5 (largest). Initially, all disks are stacked on Peg 0 in descending order (5 at the bottom, 1 at the top). The goal is to move the entire stack to Peg 2, adhering to the rules:\n\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Only the top disk of a stack can be moved.\n3. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\n### Approach to Solve the Tower of Hanoi\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi puzzle can be solved recursively. The basic idea is:\n\n- To move `n` disks from peg A to peg C using peg B as auxiliary:\n  1. Move the top `n-1` disks from A to B using C as auxiliary.\n  2. Move the `nth` disk (largest disk) from A to C.\n  3. Move the `n-1` disks from B to C using A as auxiliary.\n\nThis translates to a sequence of moves that can be generated by following the recursive steps.\n\n### Applying the Recursive Solution to 5 Disks\n\nLet's label the pegs:\n- Source peg: 0 (initial position)\n- Destination peg: 2 (target peg)\n- Auxiliary peg: 1 (used during the process)\n\nThe recursive steps for `n=5` disks:\n\n1. Move 4 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary).\n2. Move disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n3. Move 4 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary).\n\nBreaking it down further, the \"move 4 disks\" parts themselves follow the same recursive pattern.\n\n### Generating the Moves\n\nLet's enumerate the moves step by step. I'll use the recursive approach to list each move in the correct sequence.\n\nFor `n` disks, the move sequence is:\n- `n-1` disks from peg `a` to `c`, using `b`.\n- Move disk `n` from peg `a` to `c`.\n- `n-1` disks from peg `b` to `c`, using `a`.\n\nHere's how to compute the actual moves for 5 disks:\n\n#### Step 1: Move 4 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2)\nThis is equivalent to moving the top 4 disks (1,2,3,4) from peg 0 to peg 1, allowing peg 2 as the auxiliary. This is a subproblem with `n=4`, source=0, target=1, auxiliary=2.\n\nBreak this down further:\n\n1. Move 3 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1):\n   - This is `n=3`, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1.\n   - Break this down:\n     1. Move 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2):\n        - `n=2`, source=0, target=1, auxiliary=2.\n        - Break this down:\n          1. Move 1 disk from peg 0 to peg 2.\n             - Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [1,0,2]\n          2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1: [2,0,1]\n          3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1: [1,2,1]\n     2. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2: [3,0,2]\n     3. Move 2 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0):\n        - `n=2`, source=1, target=2, auxiliary=0.\n        - Break this down:\n          1. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0: [1,1,0]\n          2. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2: [2,1,2]\n          3. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [1,0,2]\n2. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 1: [4,0,1]\n3. Move 3 disks from peg 2 to peg 1 (using peg 0):\n   - `n=3`, source=2, target=1, auxiliary=0.\n   - Break this down:\n     1. Move 2 disks from peg 2 to peg 0 (using peg 1):\n        - `n=2`, source=2, target=0, auxiliary=1.\n        - Break this down:\n          1. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1: [1,2,1]\n          2. Move disk 2 from 2 to 0: [2,2,0]\n          3. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0: [1,1,0]\n     2. Move disk 3 from peg 2 to peg 1: [3,2,1]\n     3. Move 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2):\n        - `n=2`, source=0, target=1, auxiliary=2.\n        - Break this down:\n          1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [1,0,2]\n          2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1: [2,0,1]\n          3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1: [1,2,1]\n\n#### Step 2: Move disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 2\n- Move disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 2: [5,0,2]\n\n#### Step 3: Move 4 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0)\nThis is moving the 4 disks (1,2,3,4) from peg 1 to peg 2, allowing peg 0 as auxiliary. This is equivalent to a subproblem with `n=4`, source=1, target=2, auxiliary=0.\n\nFollowing the same recursive approach as in Step 1:\n\n1. Move 3 disks from peg 1 to peg 0 (using peg 2):\n   - `n=3`, source=1, target=0, auxiliary=2.\n   - Break this down:\n     1. Move 2 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0):\n        - `n=2`, source=1, target=2, auxiliary=0.\n        - Break this down:\n          1. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0: [1,1,0]\n          2. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2: [2,1,2]\n          3. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [1,0,2]\n     2. Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 0: [3,1,0]\n     3. Move 2 disks from peg 2 to peg 0 (using peg 1):\n        - `n=2`, source=2, target=0, auxiliary=1.\n        - Break this down:\n          1. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1: [1,2,1]\n          2. Move disk 2 from 2 to 0: [2,2,0]\n          3. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0: [1,1,0]\n2. Move disk 4 from peg 1 to peg 2: [4,1,2]\n3. Move 3 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 (using peg 1):\n   - `n=3`, source=0, target=2, auxiliary=1.\n   - Break this down:\n     1. Move 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2):\n        - `n=2`, source=0, target=1, auxiliary=2.\n        - Break this down:\n          1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [1,0,2]\n          2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1: [2,0,1]\n          3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1: [1,2,1]\n     2. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2: [3,0,2]\n     3. Move 2 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0):\n        - `n=2`, source=1, target=2, auxiliary=0.\n        - Break this down:\n          1. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0: [1,1,0]\n          2. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2: [2,1,2]\n          3. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [1,0,2]\n\n### Compiling the Complete Move Sequence\n\nNow, let's combine all the individual moves in the correct order. The sequence is quite long (as expected with 5 disks), requiring \\(2^5 - 1 = 31\\) moves. Here's the complete sequence:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [1,0,2]\n2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1: [2,0,1]\n3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1: [1,2,1]\n4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2: [3,0,2]\n5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0: [1,1,0]\n6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2: [2,1,2]\n7.

Move disk 3 from 2 to 1: [3,2,1]\n13. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [1,0,2]\n14. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1: [2,0,1]\n15. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1: [1,2,1]\n16. Move disk 5 from 0 to 2: [5,0,2]\n17. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0: [1,1,0]\n18. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2: [2,1,2]\n19. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [1,0,2]\n20. Move disk 3 from 1 to 0: [3,1,0]\n21. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1: [1,2,1]\n22. Move disk 2 from 2 to 0: [2,2,0]\n23. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0: [1,1,0]\n24. Move disk 4 from 1 to 2: [4,1,2]\n25. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [1,0,2]\n26. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1: [2,0,1]\n27.

Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [1,0,2]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nHere is the complete sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi with 5 disks:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [3, 0, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [4, 0, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [2, 2, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [3, 2, 1],\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [5, 0, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [3, 1, 0],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [2, 2, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [4, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [3, 0, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 2]\n]\n```",

The sequence is quite long (as expected with 5 disks), requiring \\(2^5 - 1 = 31\\) moves. Here's the complete sequence:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [1,0,2]\n2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1: [2,0,1]\n3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1: [1,2,1]\n4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2: [3,0,2]\n5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0: [1,1,0]\n6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2: [2,1,2]\n7.
