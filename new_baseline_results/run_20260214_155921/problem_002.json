Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

    "answer": "Alright, let's tackle this Towers of Hanoi puzzle step by step. We have three pegs labeled 0, 1, and 2 on computers, and three disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest). Initially, all disks are on peg 0 in order from largest (bottom, disk 3) to smallest (top, disk 1). Our goal is to move all disks to peg 2 following the given rules.\n\n### Understanding the Rules:\n1. **Move one disk at a time**: Only the topmost disk from any peg can be moved.\n2. **Larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller disk**: This means we can't put disk 3 on top of disk 2 or 1, and disk 2 can't be on top of disk 1.\n\n### Strategy:\nThis is a classic recursive problem. The general approach to move `n` disks from peg A to peg C using peg B is:\n1. Move `n-1` disks from A to B (using C).\n2. Move the largest disk (disk `n`) from A to C.\n3. Move the `n-1` disks from B to C (using A).\n\nFor `n=3`, let's apply this.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n\nLet's label pegs as:\n- Source: peg 0\n- Auxiliary: peg 1\n- Destination: peg 2\n\n#### Step 1: Move disks 1 and 2 from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2 as auxiliary)\nThis is moving `n-1=2` disks from peg 0 to peg 1.\n\n**Sub-step 1.1:** Move disk 1 to peg 2 (temporary)\n- Peg 0: [3, 2]\n- Peg 1: []\n- Peg 2: [1]\nMove: [1, 0, 2]\n\n**Sub-step 1.2:** Move disk 2 to peg 1\n- Peg 0: [3]\n- Peg 1: [2]\n- Peg 2: [1]\nMove: [2, 0, 1]\n\n**Sub-step 1.3:** Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1\n- Peg 0: [3]\n- Peg 1: [2, 1]\n- Peg 2: []\nMove: [1, 2, 1]\n\n#### Step 2: Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2\n- Peg 0: []\n- Peg 1: [2, 1]\n- Peg 2: [3]\nMove: [3, 0, 2]\n\n#### Step 3: Move disks 1 and 2 from peg 1 to peg 2 (using peg 0 as auxiliary)\nNow we have 2 disks on peg 1 to move to peg 2.\n\n**Sub-step 3.1:** Move disk 1 to peg 0\n- Peg 0: [1]\n- Peg 1: [2]\n- Peg 2: [3]\nMove: [1, 1, 0]\n\n**Sub-step 3.2:** Move disk 2 to peg 2\n- Peg 0: [1]\n- Peg 1: []\n- Peg 2: [3, 2]\nMove: [2, 1, 2]\n\n**Sub-step 3.3:** Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2\n- Peg 0: []\n- Peg 1: []\n- Peg 2: [3, 2, 1]\nMove: [1, 0, 2]\n\n### Final Sequence of Moves:\nCombining all these steps, the complete sequence is:\n\n1. [1, 0, 2] - Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2\n2. [2, 0, 1] - Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1\n3. [1, 2, 1] - Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1\n4. [3, 0, 2] - Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2\n5. [1, 1, 0] - Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0\n6. [2, 1, 2] - Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2\n7. [1, 0, 2] - Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2\n\n### Verification:\nLet's verify each step:\n\n**Initial:** [[3,2,1], [], []]\n\n1. [1,0,2]: Move 1 to peg 2 \u2192 [[3,2], [], [1]]\n2. [2,0,1]: Move 2 to peg 1 \u2192 [[3], [2], [1]]\n3. [1,2,1]: Move 1 from 2 to 1 \u2192 [[3], [2,1], []]\n4. [3,0,2]: Move 3 to 2 \u2192 [[], [2,1], [3]]\n5. [1,1,0]: Move 1 from 1 to 0 \u2192 [[1], [2], [3]]\n6. [2,1,2]: Move 2 from 1 to 2 \u2192 [[1], [], [3,2]]\n7. [1,0,2]: Move 1 from 0 to 2 \u2192 [[], [], [3,2,1]]\n\nThe final configuration matches the goal. Therefore, the sequence is correct.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```\nmoves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n```",
