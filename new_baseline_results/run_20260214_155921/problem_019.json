Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest).

    "answer": "Alright, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 5 disks. I'm going to approach this systematically, building upon the known solution for fewer disks.\n\n### Understanding the Tower of Hanoi\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive puzzle. The general strategy to move `n` disks from peg A (source) to peg C (destination) using peg B (auxiliary) involves:\n\n1. Move the top `n-1` disks from A to B using C.\n2. Move the nth disk (the largest) from A to C.\n3. Move the `n-1` disks from B to C using A.\n\n### Applying to 5 Disks\n\nFor 5 disks, labeled from 1 (smallest) to 5 (largest), initially on peg 0:\n- Peg 0: [5,4,3,2,1]\n- Peg 1: []\n- Peg 2: []\n\nWe need to move all disks to peg 2 following the rules.\n\n### Calculating the Number of Moves\n\nThe minimum number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi for `n` disks is `2^n - 1`. For 5 disks, that's `2^5 - 1 = 31` moves.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves\n\nLet's break it down recursively:\n\n1. **Move 4 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 using peg 2**: This will require 15 moves (since 2^4 - 1 = 15).\n2. **Move disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 2**: 1 move.\n3. **Move 4 disks from peg 1 to peg 2 using peg 0**: Another 15 moves.\n\nTotal: 15 + 1 + 15 = 31 moves.\n\nNow, let's list all these moves explicitly.\n\n#### Phase 1: Move 4 disks (1-4) from peg 0 to peg 1\n\nThis is like solving a smaller Tower of Hanoi for 4 disks. Here's how it breaks down:\n\n1. Move 3 disks from peg 0 to peg 2: requires 7 moves.\n2. Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 1: 1 move.\n3. Move 3 disks from peg 2 to peg 1: requires 7 moves.\n\nSimilarly, moving 3 disks is:\n- Move 2 disks to the auxiliary peg.\n- Move the 3rd disk.\n- Move 2 disks on top.\n\nAnd so forth.\n\n#### Listing All Moves\n\nHere's the complete sequence of moves, following the recursive pattern:\n\nPhase 1: Move disks 1-4 from peg 0 to peg 1 (so disk 5 can be moved)\n\n1. [1, 0, 2] (move disk 1 to peg 2)\n2. [2, 0, 1] (move disk 2 to peg 1)\n3. [1, 2, 1] (move disk 1 on top of disk 2 on peg 1)\n4. [3, 0, 2] (move disk 3 to peg 2)\n5. [1, 1, 0] (move disk 1 back to peg 0)\n6. [2, 1, 2] (move disk 2 on top of disk 3 on peg 2)\n7. [1, 0, 2] (move disk 1 on top)\n   - Now peg 0: [5,4], peg 1: [], peg 2: [3,2,1]\n8. [4, 0, 1] (move disk 4 to peg 1)\n9. [1, 2, 0] (move disk 1 to peg 0)\n10. [2, 2, 1] (move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1, on top of 4)\n11. [1, 0, 1] (move disk 1 on top of 2)\n   - peg 2: [3], peg 1: [4,2,1], peg 0: [5]\n12. [3, 2, 0] (move disk 3 to peg 0)\n13. [1, 1, 2] (move disk 1 to peg 2)\n14. [2, 1, 0] (move disk 2 on top of 3 on peg 0)\n15. [1, 2, 0] (move disk 1 on top of 2)\n   - Now peg 0: [5,3,2,1], peg 1: [4], peg 2: []\n\nPhase 2: Move disk 5 from peg 0 to peg 2\n\n16. [5, 0, 2] (move disk 5 to peg 2)\n   - peg 0: [3,2,1], peg 2: [5]\n\nPhase 3: Move disks 1-4 from peg 0 (via peg 1) to peg 2 on top of 5\n\nNow it's like moving 4 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1.\n\n17. [1, 0, 2] (move disk 1 to peg 2)\n   - peg 2: [5,1]\n18. [2, 0, 1] (move disk 2 to peg 1)\n19. [1, 2, 1] (move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1, on top of 2)\n   - peg 0: [3], peg 1: [2,1], peg 2: [5]\n20. [3, 0, 2] (move disk 3 to peg 2, on top of 5)\n21. [1, 1, 0] (move disk 1 back to peg 0)\n22. [2, 1, 2] (move disk 2 on top of 3 on peg 2)\n23. [1, 0, 2] (move disk 1 on top of 2 on peg 2)\n   - peg 0: [4], peg 1: [], peg 2: [5,3,2,1]\n24. [4, 0, 1] (move disk 4 to peg 1)\n   - peg 1: [4], peg 2: [5,3,2,1]\n25. [1, 2, 0] (move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0)\n26. [2, 2, 1] (move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1, on top of 4)\n27. [1, 0, 1] (move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1, on top of 2)\n   - peg 2: [5,3], peg 1: [4,2,1], peg 0: []\n28. [3, 2, 1] (move disk 3 from peg 2 to peg 1, on top of 1)\n   - peg 1: [4,2,1,3] - oops, this violates the rule since 3 is larger than 1. Let me re-examine this part.\n\nI realize there's a mistake in the phase 3 sequence. After step 23, peg 0 has [4], peg 1 has [], peg 2 has [5,3,2,1]. \n\nThe correct next steps should move the 4-disk stack from peg 0 to peg 2. \n\nCorrecting the sequence:\n\nAfter step 16:\n- peg 0: [3,2,1]\n- peg 1: [4]\n- peg 2: [5]\n\nThe remaining disks to move are [3,2,1] from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1.\n\nThis is a 3-disk problem:\n\n1. move 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2)\n2. move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2\n3. move 2 disks from peg 1 to peg 2\n\nLet's continue correctly:\n\n17. [1, 0, 1] (move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1)\n18. [2, 0, 2] (move disk 2 to peg 2)\n19. [1, 1, 2] (move disk 1 to peg 2, on top of 2)\n   - peg 0: [3], peg 1: [4], peg 2: [5,2,1]\n20. [3, 0, 1] (move disk 3 to peg 1, on top of 4)\n   - peg 0: [], peg 1: [4,3], peg 2: [5,2,1]\n21. [1, 2, 0] (move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0)\n22. [2, 2, 1] (move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1, on top of 3)\n23. [1, 0, 1] (move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1, on top of 2)\n   - peg 0: [], peg 1: [4,3,2,1], peg 2: [5]\n24. [4, 1, 2] (move disk 4 from peg 1 to peg 2, on top of 5)\n   - peg 1: [3,2,1], peg 2: [5,4]\n25. [1, 1, 0] (move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0)\n26. [2, 1, 2] (move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2, on top of 4)\n27. [1, 0, 2] (move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, on top of 2)\n   - peg 1: [3], peg 2: [5,4,2,1]\n28. [3, 1, 0] (move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 0)\n29. [1, 2, 1] (move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1)\n30. [2, 2, 0] (move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 0, on top of 3)\n31. [1, 1, 0] (move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0, on top of 2)\n   - peg 0: [3,2,1], peg 2: [5,4], this seems off.\n\nI see my approach became convoluted during phase 3. The structured way is:\n\nAfter moving disk 5 to peg 2 (step 16):\n\nNow we have:\n- peg 0: [4,3,2,1]\n- peg 1: []\n- peg 2: [5]\n\nThis is a 4-disk problem from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as auxiliary, but now we treat it as moving disks 1-4 to peg 2, but they are already under disk 5 which is at the bottom. So the goal is to move [4,3,2,1] onto [5] on peg 2.\n\nThis is equivalent to moving the entire stack from peg 0 to peg 2 again, but now with 4 disks and peg 2 has disk 5 which won't interfere since it's larger than all.\n\nThus:\n\nFor 4 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1:\n\n1. move 3 disks from 0 to 1 (7 moves)\n2. move disk 4 from 0 to 2\n3. move 3 disks from 1 to 2 (7 moves)\n\nTotal 15 moves, as expected.\n\nTherefore, complete sequence is:\n\n1-15: move 4 disks from 0 to 1 (with 5 remaining)\n16: move 5 from 0 to 2\n17-31: move 4 disks from 1 to 2 (on top of 5)\n\nListing all 31 moves explicitly:\n\n**Phase 1: Move 1-4 from peg 0 to peg 1 (15 moves)**\n\n1. [1, 0, 2]\n2. [2, 0, 1]\n3. [1, 2, 1]\n4. [3, 0, 2]\n5. [1, 1, 0]\n6. [2, 1, 2]\n7. [1, 0, 2]\n8. [4, 0, 1]\n9. [1, 2, 1]\n10. [2, 2, 0]\n11. [1, 1, 0]\n12. [3, 2, 1]\n13. [1, 0, 2]\n14. [2, 0, 1]\n15. [1, 2, 1]\n\nNow:\n- peg 0: [5]\n- peg 1: [4,3,2,1]\n- peg 2: []\n\n**Phase 2: Move disk 5**\n\n16. [5, 0, 2]\n\nNow:\n- peg 0: []\n- peg 1: [4,3,2,1]\n- peg 2: [5]\n\n**Phase 3: Move 1-4 from peg 1 to peg 2 (15 moves)**\n\n17. [1, 1, 0]\n18. [2, 1, 2]\n19. [1, 0, 2]\n20. [3, 1, 0]\n21. [1, 2, 1]\n22. [2, 2, 0]\n23. [1, 1, 0]\n24. [4, 1, 2]\n25. [1, 0, 2]\n26. [2, 0, 1]\n27. [1, 2, 1]\n28. [3, 0, 2]\n29. [1, 1, 0]\n30. [2, 1, 2]\n31. [1, 0, 2]\n\nFinal state:\n- peg 0: []\n- peg 1: []\n- peg 2: [5,4,3,2,1]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nHere is the complete sequence of 31 moves to solve the 5-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [3, 0, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [4, 0, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [2, 2, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [3, 2, 1],\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [5, 0, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [3, 1, 0],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [2, 2, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [4, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [3, 0, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 2]\n]\n```\n\nEach move is represented as `[disk_id, from_peg, to_peg]`, where pegs are 0-indexed (0, 1, 2 from left to right).",

[3, 2, 1] (move disk 3 from peg 2 to peg 1, on top of 1)\n   - peg 1: [4,2,1,3] - oops, this violates the rule since 3 is larger than 1. Let me re-examine this part.\n\nI realize there's a mistake in the phase 3 sequence. After step 23, peg 0 has [4], peg 1 has [], peg 2 has [5,3,2,1]. \n\nThe correct next steps should move the 4-disk stack from peg 0 to peg 2. \n\nCorrecting the sequence:\n\nAfter step 16:\n- peg 0: [3,2,1]\n- peg 1: [4]\n- peg 2: [5]\n\nThe remaining disks to move are [3,2,1] from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1.\n\nThis is a 3-disk problem:\n\n1. move 2 disks from peg 0 to peg 1 (using peg 2)\n2. move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2\n3. move 2 disks from peg 1 to peg 2\n\nLet's continue correctly:\n\n17. [1, 0, 1] (move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1)\n18. [2, 0, 2] (move disk 2 to peg 2)\n19. [1, 1, 2] (move disk 1 to peg 2, on top of 2)\n   - peg 0: [3], peg 1: [4], peg 2: [5,2,1]\n20. [3, 0, 1] (move disk 3 to peg 1, on top of 4)\n   - peg 0: [], peg 1: [4,3], peg 2: [5,2,1]\n21. [1, 2, 0] (move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0)\n22. [2, 2, 1] (move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1, on top of 3)\n23. [1, 0, 1] (move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1, on top of 2)\n   - peg 0: [], peg 1: [4,3,2,1], peg 2: [5]\n24. [4, 1, 2] (move disk 4 from peg 1 to peg 2, on top of 5)\n   - peg 1: [3,2,1], peg 2: [5,4]\n25. [1, 1, 0] (move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0)\n26. [2, 1, 2] (move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2, on top of 4)\n27. [1, 0, 2] (move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, on top of 2)\n   - peg 1: [3], peg 2: [5,4,2,1]\n28. [3, 1, 0] (move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 0)\n29. [1, 2, 1] (move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1)\n30. [2, 2, 0] (move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 0, on top of 3)\n31. [1, 1, 0] (move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0, on top of 2)\n   - peg 0: [3,2,1], peg 2: [5,4], this seems off.\n\nI see my approach became convoluted during phase 3. The structured way is:\n\nAfter moving disk 5 to peg 2 (step 16):\n\nNow we have:\n- peg 0: [4,3,2,1]\n- peg 1: []\n- peg 2: [5]\n\nThis is a 4-disk problem from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as auxiliary, but now we treat it as moving disks 1-4 to peg 2, but they are already under disk 5 which is at the bottom. So the goal is to move [4,3,2,1] onto [5] on peg 2.\n\nThis is equivalent to moving the entire stack from peg 0 to peg 2 again, but now with 4 disks and peg 2 has disk 5 which won't interfere since it's larger than all.\n\nThus:\n\nFor 4 disks from peg 0 to peg 2 using peg 1:\n\n1. move 3 disks from 0 to 1 (7 moves)\n2. move disk 4 from 0 to 2\n3. move 3 disks from 1 to 2 (7 moves)\n\nTotal 15 moves, as expected.\n\nTherefore, complete sequence is:\n\n1-15: move 4 disks from 0 to 1 (with 5 remaining)\n16: move 5 from 0 to 2\n17-31: move 4 disks from 1 to 2 (on top of 5)\n\nListing all 31 moves explicitly:\n\n**Phase 1: Move 1-4 from peg 0 to peg 1 (15 moves)**\n\n1.

[5, 0, 2]\n\nNow:\n- peg 0: []\n- peg 1: [4,3,2,1]\n- peg 2: [5]\n\n**Phase 3: Move 1-4 from peg 1 to peg 2 (15 moves)**\n\n17. [1, 1, 0]\n18. [2, 1, 2]\n19. [1, 0, 2]\n20. [3, 1, 0]\n21.
