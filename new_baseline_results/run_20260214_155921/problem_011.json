    "answer": "Alright, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks. I'm going to approach this methodically, ensuring each move adheres to the rules, and keeping track of the state after each move.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have:\n- **Peg 0**: [4, 3, 2, 1] (from bottom to top)\n- **Peg 1**: []\n- **Peg 2**: []\n\n**Goal**:\n- **Peg 0**: []\n- **Peg 1**: []\n- **Peg 2**: [4, 3, 2, 1]\n\n### Tower of Hanoi Basics\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem. For n disks, the minimal number of moves required is \\( 2^n - 1 \\). For 4 disks, that's \\( 2^4 - 1 = 15 \\) moves.\n\nThe general strategy is:\n1. Move the top \\( n-1 \\) disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the nth (largest) disk to the destination peg.\n3. Move the \\( n-1 \\) disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nFor 4 disks, this would involve:\n- Moving disks 1-3 to Peg 1 (using Peg 2 as helper).\n- Then moving disk 4 to Peg 2.\n- Then moving disks 1-3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (using Peg 0 as helper).\n\n### Recursive Breakdown\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\n#### Step 1: Move disks 1, 2, 3 to Peg 1\n\nThis is equivalent to solving the Tower of Hanoi for 3 disks, moving from Peg 0 to Peg 1, using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\nFor 3 disks (disks 1, 2, 3):\n1. Move disk 1 (top) from Peg 0 to Peg 2.\n   - State: Peg 0: [4,3,2], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [1]\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.\n   - State: Peg 0: [4,3], Peg 1: [2], Peg 2: [1]\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1 on top of disk 2.\n   - State: Peg 0: [4,3], Peg 1: [2,1], Peg 2: []\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.\n   - State: Peg 0: [4], Peg 1: [2,1], Peg 2: [3]\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0.\n   - State: Peg 0: [4,1], Peg 1: [2], Peg 2: [3]\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on top of disk 3.\n   - State: Peg 0: [4,1], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [3,2]\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 on top of disk 2.\n   - State: Peg 0: [4], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [3,2,1]\n\nNow, disks 1, 2, 3 are on Peg 2 in order [3,2,1], which is correct. Wait, no\u2014this seems off because we wanted to move disks 1-3 to Peg 1, but here they ended up on Peg 2. Let me rephrase:\n\nWe need to move disks 1-3 from Peg 0 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary. The sequence for that is:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2.\n   - State: [4,3,2], [], [1]\n2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1.\n   - State: [4,3], [2], [1]\n3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1 on 2.\n   - State: [4,3], [2,1], []\n4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2.\n   - State: [4], [2,1], [3]\n5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0.\n   - State: [4,1], [2], [3]\n6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2 on 3.\n   - State: [4,1], [], [3,2]\n7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2 on 2.\n   - State: [4], [], [3,2,1]\n\nThis correctly moves disks 1-3 to Peg 2, not Peg 1. My misstep was in assigning the pegs for the 3-disk subproblem. Let's correct:\n\nFor moving 3 disks (disks 1,2,3) from Peg 0 to Peg 1 using Peg 2:\n\n1. Move disks 1-2 to Peg 2 (using Peg 1 as auxiliary for this sub-subproblem).\n   - This is a 2-disk move.\n     - Move 1: 0\u21921: [4,3,2], [1], []\n     - Move 2: 0\u21922: [4,3], [1], [2]\n     - Move 3: 1\u21922: [4,3], [], [2,1]\n2. Move disk 3 from 0 to 1: [4], [3], [2,1]\n3. Move disks 1-2 from 2 to 1 using 0 as auxiliary:\n   - Move 1: 2\u21920: [4,1], [3], [2]\n   - Move 2: 2\u21921: [4,1], [3,2], []\n   - Move 3: 0\u21921: [4], [3,2,1], []\n\nNow disks 1-3 are on Peg 1 in order [3,2,1], and disk 4 is alone on Peg 0.\n\n#### Step 2: Move disk 4 from Peg 0 to Peg 2\n\nThis is straightforward:\n- Move disk 4 from 0 to 2.\n  - State: [], [3,2,1], [4]\n\n#### Step 3: Move disks 1, 2, 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on top of disk 4\n\nThis is another 3-disk move from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 0 as auxiliary.\n\nThe sequence:\n1. Move disks 1-2 to Peg 0 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary):\n   - Move 1: 1\u21922: Move disk 1 (top) from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on disk 4. But wait, disk 1 is the top of [3,2,1], so disk 1 vs disk 4: 1 < 4, so legal.\n     - State: [], [3,2], [4,1]\n   - Move 2: 1\u21920: Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 0.\n     - State: [2], [3], [4,1]\n   - Move 3: 2\u21920: Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 0 on disk 2.\n     - State: [2,1], [3], [4]\n2. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on disk 4.\n   - State: [2,1], [], [4,3]\n3. Move disks 1-2 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 on disk 3 using Peg 1 as auxiliary:\n   - Move 1: 0\u21921: Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.\n     - State: [2], [1], [4,3]\n   - Move 2: 0\u21922: Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 on disk 3.\n     - State: [], [1], [4,3,2]\n   - Move 3: 1\u21922: Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on disk 2.\n     - State: [], [], [4,3,2,1]\n\n### Complete Sequence of Moves\n\nNow, let's list all the moves in order from start to finish, combining the sequences above.\n\n**Phase 1: Move disks 1-3 to Peg 1**\n\nFollowing the corrected 3-disk move from Peg 0 to Peg 1 using Peg 2:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [4,3,2], [], [1]\n2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1: [4,3], [2], [1]\n3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1: [4,3], [2,1], []\n4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2: [4], [2,1], [3]\n5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0: [4,1], [2], [3]\n6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2: [4,1], [], [3,2]\n7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [4], [], [3,2,1]\n\nWait, I see that this sequence moves disks 1-3 to Peg 2, not Peg 1. My initial arrangement was off. Let me rephrase the first phase correctly:\n\nTo move disks 1-3 from Peg 0 to Peg 1 using Peg 2:\n\nThis requires applying the 3-disk algorithm where source is 0, destination is 1, auxiliary is 2.\n\nFor 3 disks:\n1. Move disks 1-2 to auxiliary (Peg 2):\n   - Move 1: 0\u21921: [4,3,2], [1], []\n   - Move 2: 0\u21922: [4,3], [1], [2]\n   - Move 3: 1\u21922: [4,3], [], [2,1]\n2. Move disk 3 to destination (Peg 1):\n   - Move 4: 0\u21921: [4], [3], [2,1]\n3. Move disks 1-2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1:\n   - Move 5: 2\u21920: [4,1], [3], [2]\n   - Move 6: 2\u21921: [4,1], [3,2], []\n   - Move 7: 0\u21921: [4], [3,2,1], []\n\nNow:\n- Peg 0: [4]\n- Peg 1: [3,2,1]\n- Peg 2: []\n\n#### Phase 2: Move disk 4 to Peg 2\n\n8. Move 8: 0\u21922: [], [3,2,1], [4]\n\n#### Phase 3: Move disks 1-3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on disk 4\n\nNow move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 0, but destination is Peg 2 which already has disk 4, and disks must go on top in order.\n\nFor 3 disks (disks 1,2,3) from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 0:\n\n1. Move disks 1-2 to Peg 0 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary):\n   - Move 9: 1\u21922: Move disk 1 (top of [3,2,1]) to Peg 2. But disk 1 is smallest, and top of Peg 2 is 4, so 1 < 4: legal.\n     - [], [3,2], [4,1]\n   - Move 10: 1\u21920: Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 0.\n     - [2], [3], [4,1]\n   - Move 11: 2\u21920: Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 0 on disk 2.\n     - [2,1], [3], [4]\n2. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on disk 4.\n   - Move 12: 1\u21922: [], [], [4,3]\n3. Move disks 1-2 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 on disk 3:\n   - Move 13: 0\u21921: Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.\n     - [2], [1], [4,3]\n   - Move 14: 0\u21922: Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 on disk 3.\n     - [], [1], [4,3,2]\n   - Move 15: 1\u21922: Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on disk 2.\n     - [], [], [4,3,2,1]\n\n### Final Sequence of Moves\n\nHere are all the moves in order:\n\nmoves = [\n    [1, 0, 1],  # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1\n    [2, 0, 2],  # Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2\n    [1, 1, 2],  # Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2\n    [3, 0, 1],  # Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1\n    [1, 2, 0],  # Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0\n    [2, 2, 1],  # Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1\n    [1, 0, 1],  # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1\n    [4, 0, 2],  # Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2\n    [1, 1, 2],  # Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2\n    [2, 1, 0],  # Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0\n    [1, 2, 0],  # Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0\n    [3, 1, 2],  # Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2\n    [1, 0, 1],  # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1\n    [2, 0, 2],  # Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2\n    [1, 1, 2]   # Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2\n]\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's verify the sequence step by step to ensure correctness.\n\n**Initial State**: \n- Peg 0: [4,3,2,1]\n- Peg 1: []\n- Peg 2: []\n\n1.

Move disks 1-2 from 2 to 1 using 0 as auxiliary:\n   - Move 1: 2\u21920: [4,1], [3], [2]\n   - Move 2: 2\u21921: [4,1], [3,2], []\n   - Move 3: 0\u21921: [4], [3,2,1], []\n\nNow disks 1-3 are on Peg 1 in order [3,2,1], and disk 4 is alone on Peg 0.\n\n#### Step 2: Move disk 4 from Peg 0 to Peg 2\n\nThis is straightforward:\n- Move disk 4 from 0 to 2.\n  - State: [], [3,2,1], [4]\n\n#### Step 3: Move disks 1, 2, 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on top of disk 4\n\nThis is another 3-disk move from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 0 as auxiliary.\n\nThe sequence:\n1. Move disks 1-2 to Peg 0 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary):\n   - Move 1: 1\u21922: Move disk 1 (top) from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on disk 4. But wait, disk 1 is the top of [3,2,1], so disk 1 vs disk 4: 1 < 4, so legal.\n     - State: [], [3,2], [4,1]\n   - Move 2: 1\u21920: Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 0.\n     - State: [2], [3], [4,1]\n   - Move 3: 2\u21920: Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 0 on disk 2.\n     - State: [2,1], [3], [4]\n2. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on disk 4.\n   - State: [2,1], [], [4,3]\n3. Move disks 1-2 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 on disk 3 using Peg 1 as auxiliary:\n   - Move 1: 0\u21921: Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.\n     - State: [2], [1], [4,3]\n   - Move 2: 0\u21922: Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 on disk 3.\n     - State: [], [1], [4,3,2]\n   - Move 3: 1\u21922: Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on disk 2.\n     - State: [], [], [4,3,2,1]\n\n### Complete Sequence of Moves\n\nNow, let's list all the moves in order from start to finish, combining the sequences above.\n\n**Phase 1: Move disks 1-3 to Peg 1**\n\nFollowing the corrected 3-disk move from Peg 0 to Peg 1 using Peg 2:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [4,3,2], [], [1]\n2. Move disk 2 from 0 to 1: [4,3], [2], [1]\n3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1: [4,3], [2,1], []\n4. Move disk 3 from 0 to 2: [4], [2,1], [3]\n5. Move disk 1 from 1 to 0: [4,1], [2], [3]\n6. Move disk 2 from 1 to 2: [4,1], [], [3,2]\n7. Move disk 1 from 0 to 2: [4], [], [3,2,1]\n\nWait, I see that this sequence moves disks 1-3 to Peg 2, not Peg 1. My initial arrangement was off. Let me rephrase the first phase correctly:\n\nTo move disks 1-3 from Peg 0 to Peg 1 using Peg 2:\n\nThis requires applying the 3-disk algorithm where source is 0, destination is 1, auxiliary is 2.\n\nFor 3 disks:\n1. Move disks 1-2 to auxiliary (Peg 2):\n   - Move 1: 0\u21921: [4,3,2], [1], []\n   - Move 2: 0\u21922: [4,3], [1], [2]\n   - Move 3: 1\u21922: [4,3], [], [2,1]\n2. Move disk 3 to destination (Peg 1):\n   - Move 4: 0\u21921: [4], [3], [2,1]\n3. Move disks 1-2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1:\n   - Move 5: 2\u21920: [4,1], [3], [2]\n   - Move 6: 2\u21921: [4,1], [3,2], []\n   - Move 7: 0\u21921: [4], [3,2,1], []\n\nNow:\n- Peg 0: [4]\n- Peg 1: [3,2,1]\n- Peg 2: []\n\n#### Phase 2: Move disk 4 to Peg 2\n\n8. Move 8: 0\u21922: [], [3,2,1], [4]\n\n#### Phase 3: Move disks 1-3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on disk 4\n\nNow move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 0, but destination is Peg 2 which already has disk 4, and disks must go on top in order.\n\nFor 3 disks (disks 1,2,3) from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 0:\n\n1. Move disks 1-2 to Peg 0 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary):\n   - Move 9: 1\u21922: Move disk 1 (top of [3,2,1]) to Peg 2. But disk 1 is smallest, and top of Peg 2 is 4, so 1 < 4: legal.\n     - [], [3,2], [4,1]\n   - Move 10: 1\u21920: Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 0.\n     - [2], [3], [4,1]\n   - Move 11: 2\u21920: Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 0 on disk 2.\n     - [2,1], [3], [4]\n2. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on disk 4.\n   - Move 12: 1\u21922: [], [], [4,3]\n3. Move disks 1-2 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 on disk 3:\n   - Move 13: 0\u21921: Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.\n     - [2], [1], [4,3]\n   - Move 14: 0\u21922: Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 2 on disk 3.\n     - [], [1], [4,3,2]\n   - Move 15: 1\u21922: Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 on disk 2.\n     - [], [], [4,3,2,1]\n\n### Final Sequence of Moves\n\nHere are all the moves in order:\n\nmoves = [\n    [1, 0, 1],  # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1\n    [2, 0, 2],  # Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2\n    [1, 1, 2],  # Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2\n    [3, 0, 1],  # Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 1\n    [1, 2, 0],  # Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0\n    [2, 2, 1],  # Move disk 2 from peg 2 to peg 1\n    [1, 0, 1],  # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1\n    [4, 0, 2],  # Move disk 4 from peg 0 to peg 2\n    [1, 1, 2],  # Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2\n    [2, 1, 0],  # Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 0\n    [1, 2, 0],  # Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 0\n    [3, 1, 2],  # Move disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 2\n    [1, 0, 1],  # Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 1\n    [2, 0, 2],  # Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 2\n    [1, 1, 2]   # Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 2\n]\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's verify the sequence step by step to ensure correctness.\n\n**Initial State**: \n- Peg 0: [4,3,2,1]\n- Peg 1: []\n- Peg 2: []\n\n1.
