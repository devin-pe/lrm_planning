Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

    "answer": "Alright, let's tackle the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 3 disks. The goal is to move all the disks from peg 0 to peg 2 following the given rules. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe have:\n- **Peg 0**: [3, 2, 1] (from bottom to top)\n- **Peg 1**: []\n- **Peg 2**: []\n\nWe need to move all disks to peg 2 in the same order: 3 at the bottom, 2 in the middle, and 1 on top.\n\n### General Strategy\nThe Tower of Hanoi problem with n disks can be solved recursively:\n1. Move the top (n-1) disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the largest disk (n) from the source peg to the target peg.\n3. Move the (n-1) disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nFor 3 disks, the steps are:\n1. Move disks 1 and 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.\n2. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n3. Move disks 1 and 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- Peg 0: [3, 2, 1]\n- Peg 1: []\n- Peg 2: []\n\n**Step 1: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.**\n- Move: [1, 0, 2]\n- Peg 0: [3, 2]\n- Peg 1: []\n- Peg 2: [1]\n\n**Step 2: Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.**\n- Move: [2, 0, 1]\n- Peg 0: [3]\n- Peg 1: [2]\n- Peg 2: [1]\n\n**Step 3: Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.**\n- Move: [1, 2, 1]\n- Peg 0: [3]\n- Peg 1: [2, 1]\n- Peg 2: []\n\n**Step 4: Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.**\n- Move: [3, 0, 2]\n- Peg 0: []\n- Peg 1: [2, 1]\n- Peg 2: [3]\n\n**Step 5: Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.**\n- Move: [1, 1, 0]\n- Peg 0: [1]\n- Peg 1: [2]\n- Peg 2: [3]\n\n**Step 6: Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.**\n- Move: [2, 1, 2]\n- Peg 0: [1]\n- Peg 1: []\n- Peg 2: [3, 2]\n\n**Step 7: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.**\n- Move: [1, 0, 2]\n- Peg 0: []\n- Peg 1: []\n- Peg 2: [3, 2, 1]\n\n### Verification\nLet's check the sequence:\n1. [1, 0, 2]: move smallest disk from 0 to 2.\n2. [2, 0, 1]: move medium disk from 0 to 1 (allowed since 1 is on 2).\n3. [1, 2, 1]: move smallest disk from 2 to 1 (on top of 2).\n4. [3, 0, 2]: move largest disk from 0 to 2 (now empty).\n5. [1, 1, 0]: move smallest disk from 1 to 0 (to make way for 2).\n6. [2, 1, 2]: move medium disk from 1 to 2 (on top of 3, which is larger).\n7. [1, 0, 2]: move smallest disk from 0 to 2 (on top of 2, which is larger).\n\nAll moves respect the rules, and we end up with all disks on peg 2 in the correct order.\n\n### Final Answer\n```python\nmoves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n```",
