Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

    "answer": "Alright, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi puzzle step by step. We have three disks labeled from smallest (1) to largest (3), initially all on peg 0, and we want to move them all to peg 2 following the given rules.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have:\n- **Initial state**: Peg 0 [3, 2, 1], Peg 1 [], Peg 2 []\n- **Goal state**: Peg 0 [], Peg 1 [], Peg 2 [3, 2, 1]\n\nThe rules are standard for Tower of Hanoi:\n1. Move one disk at a time.\n2. Only the top disk of a peg can be moved.\n3. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\n### Strategy for Tower of Hanoi\n\nThe classic recursive solution to move n disks from a source peg to a target peg using an auxiliary peg is:\n1. Move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the largest disk (n-th disk) from the source peg to the target peg.\n3. Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nFor n=3, we'll apply this recursively.\n\n### Applying to n=3 Disks\n\nLet's name the pegs:\n- Source peg: 0\n- Auxiliary peg: 1\n- Target peg: 2\n\n**Step 1: Move 2 disks (1 and 2) from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary.**\n\nBut to move 2 disks from 0 to 1:\n- First, move disk 1 from 0 to 2. (Move the smallest disk first)\n- Then, move disk 2 from 0 to 1. (Move the second disk)\n- Then, move disk 1 from 2 to 1.\n\n**Moves so far:**\n1. Move 1 from 0 to 2: [1, 0, 2]\n   - Peg 0: [3, 2], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [1]\n2. Move 2 from 0 to 1: [2, 0, 1]\n   - Peg 0: [3], Peg 1: [2], Peg 2: [1]\n3. Move 1 from 2 to 1: [1, 2, 1]\n   - Peg 0: [3], Peg 1: [2, 1], Peg 2: []\n\n**Step 2: Move disk 3 (the largest) from peg 0 to peg 2.**\n4. Move 3 from 0 to 2: [3, 0, 2]\n   - Peg 0: [], Peg 1: [2, 1], Peg 2: [3]\n\n**Step 3: Move 2 disks (1 and 2) from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary.**\n\nThis is similar to the first step but now:\n- Move disk 1 from 1 to 0.\n- Then, move disk 2 from 1 to 2.\n- Then, move disk 1 from 0 to 2.\n\n**Continuing the moves:**\n5. Move 1 from 1 to 0: [1, 1, 0]\n   - Peg 0: [1], Peg 1: [2], Peg 2: [3]\n6. Move 2 from 1 to 2: [2, 1, 2]\n   - Peg 0: [1], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [3, 2]\n7. Move 1 from 0 to 2: [1, 0, 2]\n   - Peg 0: [], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [3, 2, 1]\n\n### Verifying the Moves\n\nLet's list out all moves in order:\n\n1. [1, 0, 2]\n   - 0: [3,2], 1: [], 2: [1]\n2. [2, 0, 1]\n   - 0: [3], 1: [2], 2: [1]\n3. [1, 2, 1]\n   - 0: [3], 1: [2,1], 2: []\n4. [3, 0, 2]\n   - 0: [], 1: [2,1], 2: [3]\n5. [1, 1, 0]\n   - 0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [3]\n6. [2, 1, 2]\n   - 0: [1], 1: [], 2: [3,2]\n7. [1, 0, 2]\n   - 0: [], 1: [], 2: [3,2,1]\n\nThis matches the expected sequence where all disks are moved from peg 0 to peg 2 in the correct order.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nHere is the complete list of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [3, 0, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 2]\n]\n```",
