Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

    "answer": "Alright, let's tackle this classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle step by step. We have three disks labeled 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), initially stacked on peg 0 with disk 3 at the bottom, disk 2 in the middle, and disk 1 on top. The goal is to move the entire stack to peg 2, following the rules where we can only move one disk at a time and cannot place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi problem with `n` disks requires a minimum of `2^n - 1` moves to transfer all disks from the starting peg to the target peg. For 3 disks, that's `2^3 - 1 = 7` moves. \n\nThe general strategy is:\n1. Move the top `n-1` disks to the auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the largest disk `n` to the target peg.\n3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n### Applying to 3 Disks\n\nLet's label the pegs as follows for clarity:\n- Peg 0: starting peg (initially has disks 3, 2, 1)\n- Peg 1: auxiliary peg (initially empty)\n- Peg 2: target peg (initially empty)\n\n**Step 1: Move disks 1 and 2 to peg 1, leaving disk 3 on peg 0.**\n\nBut since we can only move one disk at a time, we'll break this down:\n- First, move disk 1 (top disk) from peg 0 to peg 2.\n  - State:\n    - Peg 0: [3, 2]\n    - Peg 1: []\n    - Peg 2: [1]\n- Next, move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.\n  - State:\n    - Peg 0: [3]\n    - Peg 1: [2]\n    - Peg 2: [1]\n- Then, move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1 (on top of disk 2).\n  - State:\n    - Peg 0: [3]\n    - Peg 1: [2, 1]\n    - Peg 2: []\n\n**Step 2: Move disk 3 (now the only disk on peg 0) to peg 2.**\n  - State:\n    - Peg 0: []\n    - Peg 1: [2, 1]\n    - Peg 2: [3]\n\n**Step 3: Move disks 1 and 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.**\nAgain, breaking this down:\n- First, move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.\n  - State:\n    - Peg 0: [1]\n    - Peg 1: [2]\n    - Peg 2: [3]\n- Next, move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2 (on top of disk 3).\n  - State:\n    - Peg 0: [1]\n    - Peg 1: []\n    - Peg 2: [3, 2]\n- Finally, move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2 (on top of disk 2).\n  - State:\n    - Peg 0: []\n    - Peg 1: []\n    - Peg 2: [3, 2, 1]\n\n### Listing the Moves\n\nLet's list each move in the format [disk_id, from_peg, to_peg]:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2: [1, 0, 2]\n   - After move: Peg 0: [3, 2], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [1]\n2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1: [2, 0, 1]\n   - After move: Peg 0: [3], Peg 1: [2], Peg 2: [1]\n3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1: [1, 2, 1]\n   - After move: Peg 0: [3], Peg 1: [2, 1], Peg 2: []\n4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2: [3, 0, 2]\n   - After move: Peg 0: [], Peg 1: [2, 1], Peg 2: [3]\n5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0: [1, 1, 0]\n   - After move: Peg 0: [1], Peg 1: [2], Peg 2: [3]\n6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2: [2, 1, 2]\n   - After move: Peg 0: [1], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [3, 2]\n7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2: [1, 0, 2]\n   - After move: Peg 0: [], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [3, 2, 1]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe complete sequence of moves is:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [3, 0, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 2]\n]\n```",
