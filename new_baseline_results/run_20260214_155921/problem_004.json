Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

    "answer": "Alright, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi puzzle step by step. We have three disks: disk 1 (smallest), disk 2 (medium), and disk 3 (largest). Initially, all disks are on peg 0 in the order [3, 2, 1], meaning disk 3 is at the bottom, then 2, then 1 on top. The goal is to move all disks to peg 2 in the same order.\n\n### Understanding the Rules\n1. **One disk at a time**: Only the top disk of any peg can be moved.\n2. **No larger disk on top of a smaller one**: At any point, a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\n### Strategy for Tower of Hanoi\nFor `n` disks, the minimal number of moves required is `2^n - 1`. Here, with `n=3`, we'll need `7` moves. The general strategy is recursive:\n1. Move the top `n-1` disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the largest disk from the source peg to the target peg.\n3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n### Applying to 3 Disks\nLet's label pegs as:\n- Source peg: 0\n- Target peg: 2\n- Auxiliary peg: 1\n\n#### Step 1: Move disks 1 and 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary\n1. Move disk 1 (top) from 0 to 2:\n   - Before: [ [3,2,1], [], [] ]\n   - After: [ [3,2], [], [1] ]\n   - Move: [1, 0, 2]\n\n2. Now, move disk 2 from 0 to 1 (since disk 1 is on peg 2, disk 2 can go to peg 1):\n   - Before: [ [3,2], [], [1] ]\n   - After: [ [3], [2], [1] ]\n   - Move: [2, 0, 1]\n\n3. Move disk 1 from 2 to 1 (on top of disk 2):\n   - Before: [ [3], [2], [1] ]\n   - After: [ [3], [2,1], [] ]\n   - Move: [1, 2, 1]\n\n#### Step 2: Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2 (the largest disk)\n4. Now, peg 0 has disk 3 alone. Move it to peg 2:\n   - Before: [ [3], [2,1], [] ]\n   - After: [ [], [2,1], [3] ]\n   - Move: [3, 0, 2]\n\n#### Step 3: Move disks 1 and 2 from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary\n5. Currently, disk 1 is on top of disk 2 on peg 1. Move disk 1 to peg 0 (since peg 2 has disk 3 which is larger, disk 1 can go on peg 0):\n   - Before: [ [], [2,1], [3] ]\n   - After: [ [1], [2], [3] ]\n   - Move: [1, 1, 0]\n\n6. Now, disk 2 is on peg 1. Move it to peg 2 (on top of disk 3):\n   - Before: [ [1], [2], [3] ]\n   - After: [ [1], [], [3,2] ]\n   - Move: [2, 1, 2]\n\n7. Finally, move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2 (on top of disk 2):\n   - Before: [ [1], [], [3,2] ]\n   - After: [ [], [], [3,2,1] ]\n   - Move: [1, 0, 2]\n\n### Verifying the Sequence\nLet's list all the moves in order:\n1. [1, 0, 2] - Move disk 1 from 0 to 2\n2. [2, 0, 1] - Move disk 2 from 0 to 1\n3. [1, 2, 1] - Move disk 1 from 2 to 1\n4. [3, 0, 2] - Move disk 3 from 0 to 2\n5. [1, 1, 0] - Move disk 1 from 1 to 0\n6. [2, 1, 2] - Move disk 2 from 1 to 2\n7. [1, 0, 2] - Move disk 1 from 0 to 2\n\nThis sequence correctly moves all disks from peg 0 to peg 2 while obeying all rules.\n\n### Final Answer\n```moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]```",
