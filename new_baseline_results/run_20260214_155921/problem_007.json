Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

    "answer": "Alright, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi puzzle step by step. We have three disks: Disk 1 (smallest), Disk 2, and Disk 3 (largest), initially all on Peg 0. Our goal is to move all disks to Peg 2 following the rules provided.\n\n### Understanding the Tower of Hanoi\nThe Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem. The general strategy to move `n` disks from one peg to another is:\n\n1. Move the top `n-1` disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the nth (largest) disk to the destination peg.\n3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nFor 3 disks, this translates to:\n\n1. Move disks 1 and 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary).\n2. Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.\n3. Move disks 1 and 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (using Peg 0 as auxiliary).\n\n### Breaking Down the Moves\n\n**Step 1: Move disks 1 and 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1**\n- To move disks 1 and 2 to Peg 1, we first need to move disk 1 out of the way so we can move disk 2.\n  a. Move disk 1 (top of Peg 0) to Peg 2.\n     - Current state: Peg 0: [3,2], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [1]\n  b. Move disk 2 from Peg 0 to Peg 1.\n     - Current state: Peg 0: [3], Peg 1: [2], Peg 2: [1]\n  c. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n     - Current state: Peg 0: [3], Peg 1: [2,1], Peg 2: []\n\n**Step 2: Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2**\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.\n  - Current state: Peg 0: [], Peg 1: [2,1], Peg 2: [3]\n\n**Step 3: Move disks 1 and 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2**\n- Now we need to move disks 1 and 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2, using Peg 0 as auxiliary.\n  a. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 0.\n     - Current state: Peg 0: [1], Peg 1: [2], Peg 2: [3]\n  b. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n     - Current state: Peg 0: [1], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [3,2]\n  c. Move disk 1 from Peg 0 to Peg 2.\n     - Current state: Peg 0: [], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [3,2,1]\n\n### Verifying the Sequence\nLet's list out the moves based on the above steps:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n2. Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.\n3. Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.\n4. Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n5. Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.\n6. Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.\n7. Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe complete sequence of moves is:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [3, 0, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 2]\n]\n```",
