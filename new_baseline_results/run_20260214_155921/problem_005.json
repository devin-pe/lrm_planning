Solve this puzzle for me.\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\nThe disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n\nmoves = [[1 , 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding\ncomplete list of moves.\n\u2022 The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n\u2022 Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]",

    "answer": "Alright, let's tackle this Tower of Hanoi puzzle step by step. We have three pegs (0, 1, 2) and three disks of sizes 3 (largest), 2, and 1 (smallest). Initially, all disks are on peg 0 in order from largest at the bottom to smallest at the top. Our goal is to move all disks to peg 2 maintaining the same order.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem where the goal is to move a stack of disks from one peg to another under specific rules:\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. A disk can only be placed on an empty peg or on top of a larger disk (no disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk).\n\nFor `n` disks, the minimal number of moves required is `2^n - 1`. For 3 disks, that's `2^3 - 1 = 7` moves.\n\n### General Approach\n\nThe strategy to solve the Tower of Hanoi is recursive:\n1. Move the top `n-1` disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, using the destination peg as auxiliary.\n2. Move the `n`th (largest) disk from the source peg to the destination peg.\n3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg, using the source peg as auxiliary.\n\nLet's label:\n- Source peg: 0\n- Destination peg: 2\n- Auxiliary peg: 1\n\n### Applying to 3 Disks\n\n**Step 1: Move the top 2 disks (1 and 2) from peg 0 to peg 1, using peg 2 as auxiliary.**\n\nThis is equivalent to solving the problem for 2 disks, but with peg 1 as the new destination.\n- Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n- Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.\n- Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.\n\nSo far:\n1. [1, 0, 2]\n2. [2, 0, 1]\n3. [1, 2, 1]\n\nNow, the state is:\n- Peg 0: [3]\n- Peg 1: [2, 1]\n- Peg 2: []\n\n**Step 2: Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.**\n- Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n\nState now:\n- Peg 0: []\n- Peg 1: [2, 1]\n- Peg 2: [3]\n\n**Step 3: Move the 2 disks (1 and 2) from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 0 as auxiliary.**\n\nThis is again solving the 2-disk problem with peg 2 as the destination.\n- Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.\n- Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.\n- Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n\nMoves:\n4.

[1, 0, 2] - Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n   - Peg 0: [3, 2], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [1]\n   \n2. [2, 0, 1] - Move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1.\n   - Peg 0: [3], Peg 1: [2], Peg 2: [1]\n   \n3. [1, 2, 1] - Move disk 1 from peg 2 to peg 1.\n   - Peg 0: [3], Peg 1: [2, 1], Peg 2: []\n   \n4. [3, 0, 2] - Move disk 3 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n   - Peg 0: [], Peg 1: [2, 1], Peg 2: [3]\n   \n5. [1, 1, 0] - Move disk 1 from peg 1 to peg 0.\n   - Peg 0: [1], Peg 1: [2], Peg 2: [3]\n   \n6. [2, 1, 2] - Move disk 2 from peg 1 to peg 2.\n   - Peg 0: [1], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [3, 2]\n   \n7. [1, 0, 2] - Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2.\n   - Peg 0: [], Peg 1: [], Peg 2: [3, 2, 1]\n\nAll moves are valid, and we've achieved the desired configuration.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1],\n    [3, 0, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 2]\n]\n```",
